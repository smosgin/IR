your excellency

i am writing to express my alarm at the recent rash of murders of journalists covering the war in chechnya at least five have been assassinated since the conflict began three of them in 1996 alone one appalling example is the executionstyle killing of obshchaya gazeta correspondent nadezhda chaikova who was killed in gekhi about 20 kilometers outside of the chechen capital of grozny i join the committee to protect journalists in their call for you to order a thorough investigation into chaikovas assassination and to bring to justice those responsible 

chaikova who was on assignment since march 6 in the chechen republic was last seen by colleagues in sernovodsk on march 19 and 20 reporters who went in search of her in early april found photographs at the urusmartanovsky district prosecutors office showing that she had been beaten blindfolded forced into a kneeling position and shot in the back of the head the prosecutor explained that her body had been discovered on the outskirts of gekhi near a sewage pipe but that a forensic exam indicated that she had been murdered elsewhere and her body dumped outside the village

chaikova who had frequently traveled to chechnya and the surrounding regions was known for her hardhitting coverage of the war and issues such as russian authorities use of special filtration prison camps to control the population

i also call on you to prosecute those responsible for the murders of four other journalists killed covering the war in chechnya

nina yefimova a 25yearold reporter for the russianlanguage chechen newspaper vozrozhdeniye revival who resided in the breakaway republic was found dead on may 9 1996 from a pistol shot to the back of the head according to itartass both nina and her mother who was also murdered were abducted from their apartment on the outskirts of grozny on the night of may 8 journalists in grozny and moscow believe that yefimovas murder was related to stories she had published on crime in chechnya on may 10 the deputy interior minister of chechnya told the radio station ekho moskvy that an investigation was opened and that suspects had been identified but no further statements have been made

on march 11 1996 viktor pimenov a cameraman for vaynakh the national chechen television station controlled by the promoscow government was killed in grozny itartass reported that day that pimenov was shot in the back by a sniper hiding on the roof of a 16floor building on lenin street he was killed while filming the aftermath of the chechen insurgents raid on grozny from march 6 to march 9 during which time russian military officials kept all journalists out of the city

on june 17 1995 natalya alyakina a freelance correspondent of dual russiangerman citizenship who worked for the german radio news service rufa and the weekly magazine focus was shot dead by a russian soldier just minutes after being waved past a russian checkpoint outside the city of budyonnovsk at the height of the hostage crisis her driver was seriously injured sergei fedotov the soldier who fired the shot claimed it was an accident but circumstances suggest that it was not and serious blunders were made in the official reenactment of the crime during the investigation the military court in stavropol announced that the trial would open in may but the hearing was cancelled when some of the states witnesses failed to appear the next session has been postponed until after the june 16 elections

farkhad kerimov a cameraman with associated press tv was shot dead in chechnya he was reported missing on may 27 1995 and his body was found on may 29

thirdly i urge you to order complete investigations into the disappearances in chechnya of four journalists

maxim shabalin the assistant political editor of the st petersburg daily nevskoye vremya and felix titov a photographer for the paper have been missing in chechnya for more than a year they left nazran on feb 27 1995 for their sixth trip to the breakaway republic since the fighting began according to nevskoye vremyas editor in chief the journalists were due back on march 4 but they have not been heard from since and are feared dead colleagues at nevskoye vremya heard word in september that the bodies of two journalists were found in february in the achoy region of the republic however no documents or photographs were located to confirm the identities of the bodies

nevskoye vremyas sergei ivanov traveled to chechnya on june 16 1995 to look for shabalin and titov he has not been heard from since

 andrew shumack an american freelance journalist from pennsylvania was last seen on july 28 1995 when he left grozny and headed toward the surrounding mountainous area the st petersburg press an englishlanguage newspaper had provided shumack with a letter of introduction on july 20 to help him obtain press credentials in return shumack was to provide them with photographs and stories for three months he is feared dead because no one from the newspaper has heard from him since and us embassy officials have not been able to locate him despite repeated trips to the region

and lastly i join cpj in their call for the release from jail of two turkish journalists

ali tekin managing editor of the turkish islamic weekly selam and talip ozcelik a reporter with the weekly were arrested on nov 2 1995 while trying to enter chechnya russian authorities told their colleagues at selam that they are being held for illegal entry the pair was first held in derbent and are now believed to be detained in makhachkala capital of dagestan according to the anatolia news agency on april 10 1996 a court in dagestan sentenced the two men under article 83 of the russian penal code to three years in prisonthe maximum sentence permitted under the lawfor illegal bordercrossing

in order for a free press to survive in russia journalists must be allowed to travel and report freely without fear for their safety or fear of arbitrary jailing i respectfully request that you take all measures to ensure that security
