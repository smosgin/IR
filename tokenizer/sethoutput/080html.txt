airsar data compression formats


	for airsar data there are four possible formats   

		1 compressed stokes matrix data 
			multilookquadpol lowres 10 bytespixel
		2 compressed scattering matrix 730 processor data 
			single lookquadpol10 bytespixel
		3 compressed scattering matrix 35 processor data 
			single lookquadpol lowres 10 bytespixel
		4 uncompressed synoptic amplitude data 
			vax real4 single pol lowres 4 bytespixel
	in the following descriptions
	
		sign  will return the sign of the argument  � 1 

		nint  will indicate that the nearest integer value is calculated of its 
argument  

		int  will indicate that the truncation of the floating point value to integer 
is calculated of its argument and that if the floating point value is less than zero 
subtraction by 10 is additionally required  note that this is not the same as fortran 
int 

		genfac is the airsar general scale factor whose value is recorded in the 
header of the oldheader field 133




stokes matrix data

	airsar compressed stokes matrix cm quadpol data  10 bytes per pixel   
consists of one file for each scene per frequency  each line of each file consists of 1024 
azimuth samples  there are 750 or 1282 lines depending on the processor each 
corresponding to progressively greater range from the radar  the azimuth pixel spacing 
is 121 meters for the pre1993 prf and 8 meters for the 1993 and later prf  the range 
pixel spacing is 666 meters assumes 20 mhz data  the first two or three lines in the 
file are header lines  the data has been symmetrized such that shv = 05 shv +svh 
and is usually calibrated  for the 730 processor the data has been multilooked by 4 
while for the 35 processor the data has been multilooked by 16  

� 10 bytes per pixel  quadpol data with

	� byte9  nint127 m34qsca
	� byte10  nint127 m44qsca
	the total power is 
		tp = m11 = genfac  byte2  254 + 15 2byte1 
	the remaining terms are given by 

		m12 = m11 byte3 127
		m13 = signbyte4 m11 byte4 1272
		m14 = signbyte5 m11 byte5 1272
		m23 = signbyte6 m11 byte6 1272
		m24 = signbyte7 m11 byte7 1272
		m33 = m11 byte8 127
		m34 = m11 byte9 127
		m44 = m11 byte10 127
		m22 = m11  m33  m44

	the difference between the airsar cm data and sirc mlc data is chiefly 
that for airsar the elements of the stokes matrix are stored directly to each 
compressed byte  while for sirc the crossproducts that when combined appropriately 
comprise the stokes matrix are stored  in addition the airsar data employs a general 
scale factor while sirc does not  and finally the value stored in the first two bytes by 
airsar is the total power divided by the general scale factor while the value stored in 
the first two bytes by sirc is four times the total power



the stokes matrix and crossproducts

the symmetrized stokes matrix may be formed from the crossproducts of the scattering 
matrix that are stored by sirc in the mlc format as follows

	m11 = shhshh + svvsvv + 2shvshv  40
	m12 = shhshh  svvsvv  40
	m13 = reshhshv + reshvsvv   20
	m14 = imshhshv  imshvsvv   20
	m21 = m12
	m22 = shhshh +svvsvv  2shvshv   40
	m23 =  reshhshv  reshvsvv   20
	m24 = imshhshv + imshvsvv  20
	m31 = m13
	m32 = m23
	m33 = shvshv  + reshhsvv  20
	m34 = imshhsvv  20
	m41 = m14
	m42 = m24
	m43 = m34
	m44 = shvshv  reshhsvv  20

	the crossproducts in terms of the symmetrized stokes matrix elements are 

	shhshh = 2m12 + 2m11  m33  m44
	shvshv = m33 + m44
	svvsvv = 2m11  2m12  m33  m44
	shhshv = complex m13 + m23 m14  m2 4 
	shhsvv = complex  m33  m44 2m34 
	shvsvv = complex m13  m23 m14 + m24 
 

	for slc data the stokes matrix will not be symmetrized  the unsymmetrized 
stokes matrix is given by

	m11 = shhshh + shvshv + svhsvh + svvsvv  40
	m12 = shhshh  shvshv + svhsvh  svvsvv  40
	m13 = reshhshv + resvhsvv   20
	m14 = imshhshv  imsvhsvv   20
	m21 = shhshh + shvshv  svhsvh  svvsvv  40
	m22 = shhshh + svvsvv  shvshv  svhsvh  40
	m23 =  reshhshv  resvhsvv   20
	m24 = imshhshv + imsvhsvv  20
	m31 = reshhsvh + reshvsvv   20
	m32 =  reshhsvh  reshvsvv   20
	m33 = shvshv  + reshhsvv  20
	m34 = imshhsvv+imshvsvh  20
	m41 =  imshhsvh  imshvsvv   20
	m42 = imshhsvh + imshvsvv  20
	m43 =  imshhsvv  imshvsvh  20
	m44 = reshvsvh  reshhsvv  20
