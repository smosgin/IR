press release from representative rick white

white applauds phildelphia court ruling

washington dc   june 12 1996  representative rick white rfirst district today applauded the court ruling that found the communications decency act cda unconstitutional

quottodays ruling makes the same point that we tried to make to congress last year  if youre going to protect kids on the internet you have to do it in a way that protects everyone elses freedom of speech  we can do that but not the way we tried to do it in this billquot white said quotone of the only smart things we did in this bill was to include an expedited judicial review so that the supreme court would hear this case within the year  the fate of the internet now goes before the supreme court and once they make their ruling we will have a chance to go back to the drawing board to find a solution that protects our kids and our freedom of speechquot



last year white developed an alternative to the cda which would have replaced the quotindecency standardquot with the more constitutional quotharmful to minorsquot standard  in addition whites compromise developed a strong effective law that targets wrongdoers focused on the use of parental empowerment software  and gave incentives for industry to develop new technologies to screen out content that is inappropriate for children  most of his compromise was included in the final bill however at the last minute a narrow majority replaced whites the quotharmful to minorsquot standard with the quotindecency standardquot



quotwere kidding ourselves if we think the federal government can totally solve this problemquot white continued  quoti have four kids who surf the net and my wife and i spend a great deal of time determining what our kids can access  that is a decision that i want to make with my wife not a federal bureaucrat in washington dcquot



in march of this year white founded the internet caucus in order to educate members about the internet  the caucus now 48 members strong has worked to educate members of congress about the internet and to encourage more members to get online



quotthe cda debate sent a pretty clear signal that many members of congress are lost in cyberspacequot white said  quotthe bottom line is that were never going to get good laws until we get our legislators up to speed on net issues  the courts decision this morning will help educate members and so will the internet caucus  when congress rewrites the cda next year i am optimistic that we will have more enlightened members who wonï¿½t make the same mistake twicequot



tomorrow white will join the three other cofounders of the internet caucus in introducing a sense of congress resolution calling on members to get up to speed on internet related issues and use this new medium to communicate with their constituents  the nonbinding resolution will be introduced in both the house and the senate
