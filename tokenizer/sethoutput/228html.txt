this image of fort irwin in californias mojave desert 
compares interferometric radar signatures topography  data 
that were obtained by multiple imaging of the same region  
to produce threedimensional elevation maps  as it was 
obtained on october 78 1994 by the spaceborne imaging 
radarcxband synthetic aperture radar aboard the space 
shuttle endeavour  data were acquired using the  lband 24 
centimeter wavelength and cband 6 centimeter wavelength  
the image covers an area about 25 kilometers by 70 
kilometers 155 miles by 43 miles  north is to the lower 
right of the image  the color contours shown are 
proportional to the topographic elevation with a wavelength 
onefourth that of the lband the results from the cband 
cycle through the color contours four times faster for a 
given elevation change  detailed comparisions of these 
multiple frequency data over different terrain types will 
provide insights in the future into wavelengthdependent 
effects of penetration and scattering on the topography 
measurement accuracy  fort irwin is an ideal site for such 
detailed digital elevation model comparisions because a 
number of high precision digital models of the area already 
exist from conventional measurements as well as from 
airborne interferometric sar data
