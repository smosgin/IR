this is a digital elevation model that was geometrically 
coded directly onto an xband seasonal change image of the 
oetztal supersite in austria  the image is centered at 
4682 degrees north latitude and 1079 degrees east 
longitude  this image is located in the central alps at the 
border between switzerland italy and austria 50 kilometers 
31 miles southwest of innsbruck  it was acquired by the 
spaceborne imaging radarcxband synthetic aperture aboard 
the space shuttle endeavour on april 14 1994 and on october 
5 1994  it was produced by combining data from these two 
different data sets data obtained in april is green data 
obtained in october appears in red and blue and was used as 
an enhancement based on the ratio of the two data sets  
areas with a decrease in backscatter from april to october 
appear in light blue cyan such as the large 
gepatschferner glacier seen at the left of the image center 
and most of the other glaciers in this view  a light blue 
hue is also visible at the east border of the dark blue lake 
reschensee at the upper left side  this shows a significant 
rise in the water level  magenta represents areas with an 
increase of backscatter from april 10 to october 5 yellow 
indicates areas with high radar signal response during both 
passes such as the mountain slopes facing the radar  low 
radar backscatter signals refer to smooth surface lakes or 
radar grazing areas to radar shadow areas seen in the 
southeast slopes  the area is approximately 29 kilometers 
by 21 kilometers 18 miles by 135 miles  the summit of 
the main peaks reaches elevations of 3500 to 3768 meters 
xx feet to xx feet above sea level  the test sites core 
area is the glacier region of venter valley which is one of 
the most intensively studied areas for glacier research in 
the world  research in venter valley below center 
includes studies of glacier dynamics glacierclimate 
regions snowpack conditions and glacier hydrology  about 
25 percent of the core test site is covered by glaciers  
corner reflectors are set up for calibration  five corner 
reflectors can be seen on the gepatschferner and two can be 
seen on the vernagtferner
