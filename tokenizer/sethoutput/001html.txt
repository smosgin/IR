international press freedom awards









in recognition of more than two decades of courageous journalism in defiance of political pressure and violence that cost the life of his associate the committee to protect journalists will present j jesus blancornelas editor of the mexican newspaper zeta with its prestigious international press freedom award

when blancornelas and longtime colleague hector feacutelix miranda cofounded zeta a feisty weekly newspaper in the mexicous border city of tijuana in 1980 they set a bold agenda for mexican journalism in a country where the news media had historically kowtowed to government interests and where bribetaking among journalists was so commonplace that it spawned a litany of catchphrases zeta dared to provide what few other mexican newspapers had hardhitting stories on mexico146s most vexing problemsofficial corruption and drug trafficking

the cost of zeta146s independence has been high feacutelix a popular columnist known as feacutelix the cat whose writing frequently targeted the wealthy and powerful was murdered in 1988 a year before unidentified assailants riddled the zeta  office with bullets and over the years the newspaper has suffered waves of harassment ranging from confiscation of its issues to outright threats to advertisers

feacutelix146s death is one of 10 cases documented by cpj over the past decade of mexican journalists who were murdered in apparent reprisal for their work in virtually every case investigations have been incomplete or contradictory leaving key questions unresolved and leading suspects uninvestigated 

zetas  drama has played out in one of the most contentious and volatile regions of mexico in 1989 baja california was the first state in mexico to elect an opposition governor ernesto ruffo appel of the centerright national action party ending the political monopoly of the ruling institutional revolutionary party pri blancornelas and zeta played a pivotal role in this historic political turning point by providing a forum for opposition viewpoints and subjecting previous governments to close investigative scrutiny 

in recent years tijuana has been one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in mexico146s ongoing internecine drug war which threatens the country146s economic and political stability as well as its social fabric tijuana was also the site in 1994 of mexico146s most traumatic political assassination since the tumultuous aftermath of the 1910 revolution when the pri presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio was assassinated after a campaign rally in the working class lomas taurino neighborhood

despite the risks blancornelas has not been deterred largely inspired by his example a newly empowered generation of independent welltrained journalists are rejecting the old habits of selfcensorship bribetaking and government subsidies to provide the mexican public with more balanced coverage of the news

in the spirit of the international press freedom awards whose previous recipients have included the courageous irish investigative journalist veronica guerin assassinated in june and other pioneers and guardians of a free press who have risked political persecution and personal hardship cpj is honored to give an award this year to blancornelas

the uphill climb to establish an independent voice in tijuana

blancornelas and feacutelix launched zeta soon after losing control of another tijuana newspaper abc which they had started in 1977 the daily146s hallmark was indepth reporting of government corruption in late 1979 the paper was taken over by a governmentcontrolled labor union in a move orchestrated by baja gov roberto de la madrid a member of the pri the takeover occurred after blancornelas had refused de la madrid146s demand that he fire feacutelix the paper146s star columnist

fearful that zeta which picked up where abc left off would be a target of government reprisal blancornelas decided to edit and publish the paper from san diego for a couple of years to avoid a shutdown by mexican authorities who controlled a newsprint monopoly meanwhile feacutelix stayed in tijuana writing irreverent columns about the backroom happenings of social and political life in baja california

felix murder enrages mexican public

in 1988 feacutelix who served as coeditor of zeta was assassinated while driving to work along a narrow tijuana street outrage followed his murder thousands attended the funeral and an unusual alliance of tijuana journalists and political officials demanded justice they would not allow this murder to be left unsolved as had those of many other mexican journalists

two employees of a tijuana racetrack owned by the son of a powerful pri politician and power broker were eventually convicted of the shooting and they are currently serving prison sentences but authorities never established a motive for the assassination and it is widely believed the intellectual authors remain at large

in the wake of feacutelix146s murder blancornelas continued to print his colleague146s name on the masthead of zeta and in each edition reproduced one of feacutelix146s columns opposite a black page that askedwho killed me

in the year following feacutelix146s murder several journalists found their careers threatened when they criticized how the case was being handled five reporters were fired from the daily el herald after they published a special edition critical of the investigation the five later formed their own weekly journal cambio 21 two radio commentators were given unplannedvacations after opening their morning talk shows to callers critical of the police investigation and other journalists said they felt subtle pressures to tone down coverage of the case

blancornelas sets precedent for mexican journalists fighting government control of press

with both abc and zeta blancornelas insisted that his newspapers not be beholden to anyone in an effort to bypass one of the most onerous government controls over the pressa requirement that all newsprint be purchased directly from the mexican government146s newsprint monopoly blancornelas went to san diego in 1981 and there printed zeta and exported it to tijuana according to blancornelas mexican authorities could not block zeta146s import because they would have been forced to do the same with us publications entering the country

in 1990 mexican president carlos salinas decided to sell the newsprint monopoly enabling newspapers to buy newsprint directly from foreign manufacturers but the lingering fear of government interference remains and some mexican newspapers have opted to publish on the us side of the border newspapers in hermosillo sonora for instance are printed in tucson arizona and some papers in ciudad juarez chihuahua are printed in el paso texas

blancornelas has also been an inspiring figure for those mexican journalists eager to break the bribetaking habits of their predecessors as late as 1989 it was still common practice for reporters editors and columnists to take money from elected officials government bureaucrats and businessmen in exchange for flattering profiles or uncritical coverage from zeta146s founding in 1980 blancornelas made the paper146s policy clear bribetaking is unacceptable the slightest suspicion of bribetaking is cause for dismissal blancornelas says and to date no cases have come to light journalists make good money here they don146t need it bribes he said

zeta146s example has helped bring about a sea change in the way mexican journalists do business and how they view their role in 1990 baja california gov ruffo prohibited state officials from offering government bribes to journalists former mexican president carlos salinas de gortari enacted a similar policy among his cabinet as a result says blancornelasï¿½ the traditionbound daily newspapers have no other recourse but to change their tainted politics speak the truth and learn to survive through advertising and circulation sales or die

blancornelas146 refusal to abide by the status quo which has shackled and silenced mexico146s press has helped myriad publishers editors and reporters find the courage to build a free and independent press there throughout mexico blancornelas has been recognized as a pioneer a rare example of courage and independence in the provincial press for more than two decades
