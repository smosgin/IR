certain times each month are poor times to make major decisions or purchases  these are the times when your purchases turn out to be something you never wear or use  they are also disastrous times to hold important meetings
when the moon is �void of course� we become like floating balloons of helium and can�t trust our decisionmaking skills because we are not grounded whatever we initiate during these times tends not to fulfill its purpose
keep an eye on the times listed in this column
 
during these times

don�t begin anything important
don�t make major purchases
don�t make important plans
expect shortages delays and goofups
