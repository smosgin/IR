srl2  kliuchevskoi volcano opticalradar comparison
kliuchevskoi volcano opticalradar comparison 
 
this comparison shows optical and radar imaging of kliuchevshoi
volcano in kamchatka russia which began to erupt on september
30 1994 as space shuttle mission sts68 was beginning with its
spaceborne imaging radar cxband synthetic aperture radar
sircxsar payload

the optical photo at left was taken by shuttle astronauts during
the early hours of the eruption on september 30  the ash plume
which reached heights of more than 18 kilometers 50000 feet is 
emerging from a vent on the north flank of kliuchevskoi partially hidden 
by the plume and its shadow in this view  the photograph is 
oriented with north toward the bottom for comparison with 
the radar image at right acquired a few 
days later  near the center of the photo a small whitish 
steam plume may be seen emanating from the growing lava dome 
of a companion volcano bezymianny

in the radar image at right kliuchevskoi is the blue triangular peak in 
the center of the image towards the left edge of the bright red 
area that delineates bare snow cover  the image was 
acquired by sircxsar aboard the space shuttle 
endeavour on its 88th orbit on october 5 1994  the image 
shows an area approximately 75 kilometers by 100 kilometers 
46 miles by 62 miles that is centered at 5607 degrees 
north latitude and 16084 degrees east longitude  north is 
toward the bottom of the image  the radar illumination is 
from the top of the image  the kamchatka volcanoes are 
among the most active volcanoes in the world  the volcanic 
zone sits above a tectonic plate boundary where the pacific 
plate is sinking beneath the northeast edge of the eurasian 
plate the endeavour crew obtained dramatic video and 
photographic images of this region during the eruption 
which will assist scientists in analyzing the dynamics of 
the recent activity the colors in this image were obtained 
using the following radar channels red represents the l
band horizontally transmitted and received green 
represents the lband horizontally transmitted and 
vertically received blue represents the cband 
horizontally transmitted and vertically received  in 
addition to kliuchevskoi two other active volcanoes are 
visible in the image  bezymianny the circular crater above 
and to the right of kliuchevskoi contains a slowly growing 
lava dome  tolbachik is the large volcano with a dark 
summit crater near the upper right edge of the red snow 
covered area  the kamchatka river runs from right to left 
across the bottom of the image  the current eruption of 
kliuchevskoi included massive ejections of gas vapor and 
ash which reached altitudes of 15000 meters 50000 feet  
melting snow mixed with volcanic ash triggered mudflows on 
the flanks of the volcano  paths of these flows can be seen 
as thin lines in various shades of blue and green on the 
north flank in the center of the image
