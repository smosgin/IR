tesla was right

the coming free energy revolution

by joseph duggan


147ere many generations pass our machinery will be driven
by a power obtainable at any point in the universe throughout
space there is abundant energy148

151nicola tesla 18571943

jeane manning canadian author of the coming energy revolution151the
search for free energy  strongly agrees with nicola tesla146s
prediction and in fact envisions that production models of free
energy devices are 147just around the corner148  on the
cover of her new book manning states 147there is a new and
exciting revolution coming it will dramatically change our landscape
our environment our economy and our lives it will provide each
and every one of us with a truly unique sense of independence
it will mark the end of oilinfluenced politics and the beginning
of a bright new millennium151a time in which we will all have
our own unlimited sources of nonpolluting energy which will power
our vehicles heat our homes and light up our lives however
it will not come without a struggle as history has already shown148

jeane manning is a freelance journalist who since 1981 has traveled
throughout north america and europe to both study and report on
newenergy technologies her articles and essays have appeared
in numerous energy journals as well as several books she has
worked as a newspaper reporter and editor raised three children
and now resides in vancouver bc what made her step off a safe
career ladder ten years ago and into the uncertainty of researching
the nonconventional 145free energy146 movement 

147i was living in vernon bc and heard about an inventor
in penticton who invented an extraordinary magnetic dynamo he
named his company pran tech because he believed that powerful
magnets somehow suck in the 145prana146151a subtle energy
recognized by the ancients151from the air around us using
a superefficient arrangement of permanent magnets and electrical
coils he claimed the machine when fully developed would put out
more electricity than it took to run it 

147i didn146t understand the technical explanations at the
time but i was convinced that he sincerely wanted to help clean
up the planet with a pollutionfree energy source i thought
145if this is real we won146t need to dam any more wild
rivers or poison the air  if it is bona fide then as a journalist
i want to spread the word about it when the time is right148
fifteen years later the time was right

the coming energy revolution  published in 1996 covers the history
of free energy research explains the conceptual basis of this
new technology and introduces us to some of the inventors their
struggles failures and successes manning146s research has
placed her in the middle of an international subculture that is151excuse
the pun151electric with excitement over recent developments
in nonconventional energy alternatives 

the scene is no longer filled with garage inventors and 145mad
scientists146 instead a small but increasing number of serious
researchers with phds in physics or engineering is convinced that
mainstream science texts will have to be rewritten some of these
people publish articles in respected physics journals explaining
that the 147zeropoint quantum fluctuations of the vacuum of
space148 could be cohered into a usable energy source   

free energy is a misnomer manning points out because there is
a cost associated with building machines to generate electrical
energy even if the nonconventional machines need no fuel to
operate  however the phrase caught the imagination of many people
over the years and is now used in some circles as a slogan with
145free146 as a verb151 147let146s free energy148

today146s energy researchers such as hal fox phd of salt
lake city prefer terms such as 145space energy146 to describe
the incredible amounts of power available in the socalled vacuum
of space around us  respected theorists say there is enough
potential energy in the vacuum in a light bulb to boil all the
world146s oceans if it could be put to use newenergy theorists
want to use only a trickle of that energy to give the world a
clean source of power  

as with the personal computer revolution 20 years ago inventors
are making breakthroughs in home workshops and garages as well
as private laboratories observers of the science underground
predict that this revolution will have even more of an impact
on society than pcs have had it could do more than transform
our homes vehicles and factories it will also provide a means
to clean up rivers as well as the air and soils

scrutiny of the emerging energy field reveals a complex picture
with dark areas of greed corporate lobbying international energy
politics bureaucratic inertia academic resistance secrecy
and inventors146 paranoia  147however the bright spots
of irrepressible new discoveries are growing increasingly faster
and are showing up in unexpected places  cooperative efforts
may win out as leadingedge scientists and many independent innovators
from about 30 countries now are working towards the same goal148


manning has covered recent developments in free energy technology
for instance 145cold fusion146 has been successfully repeated
and japan for one is investing millions of dollars into cold
fusion research other water fuel cell technologies hold promise
for cleaning up the atmosphere as they power vehicles revolutionary
advances towards clean abundant power also use sunshine and heat
in the air or in the ground to make electricity through superefficient
solar photovoltaics or advancedconcept heat pumps a canadian
company has developed efficient smallscale generators which
revolve in a stream of water or in ocean tides without harming
marine life 

a variety of prototype 145zeropoint vacuum energy146 devices
apparently tap the energy in space they include magnetic electrostatic
electrodynamic and solidstate ways to generate electricity
 except for the initial cost of equipment and minimal maintenance
the expected result will be costfree electricity generators
that access this energy are now operating making it likely that
within the next decade new energy production methods will take
energy out of the 145air146 with no negative byproducts


changes manning claims we can look forward to in the near future
include no longer having to pay a utility bill or buy gasoline
and so being able to leasepurchase the energy converter after
the hardware is paid for the electrical energy you use is free


former astronaut with the apollo program brain o146leary
phd gave up lucrative employment151as an ivy league physics
professor energy consultant to governments and space scientist
on nasa contracts151in order to address questions which other
academics have ignored up to now he now lives the challenging
life of an author and independent scientist  

he says 147because the free energy that surrounds us is such
a vast resource so potentially clean and decentralized some
of us believe an energy revolution is imminent afterward existing
energy sources may be seen as dinosaur nightmares that littered
our landscape and polluted our air this revolution could open
a new paradigm of science and technology that would make the copernican
and industrial revolutions appear tame  redirecting $2 trillion
per year from obsolete power systems to sustainable and affordable
systems is an unprecedented change with vast possibilities

147a switch to clean 145free energy146 could almost totally
alleviate air pollution global warming from carbon dioxide emissions
waste heat incidents such as saddam hussein146s ecocidal fires
black skies valdezlike oil spills acid rain nitrogen dioxide
sulfur dioxide hydrocarbon and ozone emissions unsightly oil
production and refining facilities dangerous supertankers gas
stations power stations transmission lines etc148

manning says 147the energy revolution could affect people146s
lives151their practical everyday choices151profoundly because
decentralized power means freedom  it means empowerment to clean
up our environment instead of feeling helpless the megaprojectbuilders
will no longer have a leg to stand on when they claim their projects
are necessary      

147people have to take back their power at the individual and
local level it won146t be handed back in an envelope from
the government the tax structure as well as electric utilities
will need to be changed because of all the energyrelated tentacles
that stretch out from capital cities and from financial centers
like wall street and reach into citizens146 wallets148

manning has researched the new energy scene since 1981 and is
in ongoing contact  with many inventors theorists and other
networkers in about a dozen countries she has attended more than
20 energyrelated conferences in switzerland west germany 
canada and the united states she has coauthored several books
about  new science including  suppressed inventions and other
discoveries  coauthored with christopher bird brian o146leary
and barry lynes and published in new zealand by auckland institute
of technology press the granite man  and the butterfly  coauthored
with pierre sinclaire and published by  project magnet fort langley
bc  and angels don146t play  this haarp with dr nick begich
of  alaska 

jeane manning will be giving a public lecture on the free energy
revolution at the vancouver planetarium at 730pm on friday november
15 tickets are available at banyen sound she will present slides
and video clips of working free energy devices and will be joined
at the podium by some wellknown local researchers involved in
antigravity magnetic propulsion and free energy generators
