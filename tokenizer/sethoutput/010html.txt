the private press the challenges facing independent journalists

the economic challenges facing private publishers include competition a small pool of advertising revenue and the fluctuating price of newsprint on the international market publishers also complain that they are crippled by an informal ban on advertisements placed by stateowned institutions in the private press by the refusal of government media to accept paid promotional advertising from private newspapers and by the reported warnings that private businesses have received about the repercussions of placing advertisements simultaneously in both the state and private press

technologically the private press is more advanced than the state press but this advantage may be shortlived because the government is now three years into a major modernization program for its news organs

operating on shoestring budgets with skeleton staffs many private newspapers and magazines lay out their publications themselves on personal computers equipped with outdated desktop publishing programs that are modified to work in both the amharic and english languages using laser printers to prepare cameraready page proofs selftaught production staffs produce the most basic graphics these publications would greatly benefit from access to more sophisticated technology and production training

the independent press publishes products that vary in editorial quality and political analysis englishlanguage newspapers reflect the decline of englishlanguage instruction in the educational system and both amharic and englishlanguage publications reflect the negligible editorial skills of the majority of   practicing journalists

some newspapers like the addis tribune and the monitor which have been accused in the past of treading too carefully to avoid the perception of criticizing the government are now covering more local and political issues as well as press freedom and human rights however the bulk of the criticism directed squarely at the government can be found in publications like tobia and urji which are regarded as political opposition papers by the government and its supporters there is some justification for the government146s view some independent publishers and journalists were partisans of col mengistu others of the late emperor haile selassie and others still of various ethnic insurgent groups this however does not justify the state146s intolerance of the expression of opposing viewpoints
