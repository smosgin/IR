on the edge mugs

a quick message about the onte mugs of which i own the rain of walrus
disclaimeri am not associated in any way with mystic images i just like the mugs =

my name is larry  owner of mystic images  a graphics
imprinting company  we have a licensing agreement with atlas games to
reproduce onte cards on mugs coffee cups these cups are being
produced with a print run of only 1000 each the whole card is printed
on the mug and is left hand facing which means if you hold the mug in
your left hand the image faces you

right now we have 4 cards available

	rain of walrus
	koanhead
	dr nussbaum
	monique daubaine

the price is $1000 each
shipping is $300 for the first and $100 for aditional mugs
 soooo if you ordered 4 mugs your cost would be $40 for mugs and $600 for
shipping get the idea

until my web page is upall contacts can be made to
mysticozaolcom
