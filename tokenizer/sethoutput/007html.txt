introduction

the cryosphere is a major component of the hydrosphere and interacts
significantly with the global climate system the geosphere and the 
biosphere
over 30 percent of the earths land surface is covered seasonally by snow and
about 10 percent is covered permanently with snow or ice

snow and ice play important interactive roles in regional climates because
snow has a higher albedo than any other natural surface the earliest signs of
global climate change are likely in the polar regions and in the seasonal snow
cover and alpine glaciers for investigations in hydrology and landsurface
climatology seasonal snow cover and alpine glaciers are critical to the
radiation and water balances over major portions of the middle and high
latitudes and at high elevations in the tropical latitudes snow and alpine
glaciers are the largest contributors to runoff in rivers and to groundwater
recharge the dual problems of estimating both the quantity of water held by
seasonal snow packs and timing of snowmelt confront snow hydrologists
understanding the processes in the seasonal snow cover is also important for
studies of the chemical balance of alpine drainage basins because of
translocation of anions and cations within the snow pack and possible
concentrated release in the first phases of the melt season

soil moisture is an environmental descriptor that integrates much of the land
surface hydrology and is the interface for interaction between the solid earth
surface and life  as central as this seems to mans existence and
biogeochemical cycles it is a descriptor that has not had wide spread
application as a variable in any land process models  there are two primary
reasons for this  it is a difficult variable to measure not at one point in
time but in a consistent and spatially comprehensive basis  also it exhibits
very large spatial and temporal variability thus point measurements have had
very little meaning  the practical result of this is that soil moisture has
not been used as measurable variable in any of our current hydrologic
climatic agricultural or biogeochemical models

both passive microwave and active microwave sar techniques have 
provided
solid theoretical and experimental results that the top five cm of soil
moisture can be measured from aircraft and space platforms under a variety of
environmental conditions and through a moderate vegetation cover <a

issues and application opportunities that can be addressed by microwave 
remote
sensing of soil moisture and snow water equivalence describe the capabilities
and limitations of the passive and sar systems describe the progress to date
and document the research still needed to take this technology to an
operational status



background

the scientific objectives related to snow and ice identified by the national
research council are

	to study the global hydrologic cycle to determine the distributions
dimensions properties and relevant dynamics of snow sea and lake ice ice
sheets and shelves

	to determine and understand the mechanisms for the transfers of water 
between
the major global reservoirs glacier flow melting and freezing

	to predict on appropriate time scales the distributions volumes and 
fluxes
associated with snow cover sea ice ice sheets and shelves ground ice and
permafrost

although snow and ice phenomena play important roles in global processes
difficult access hampers data collection and conventional studies of snow and
ice cannot address the correct scales of most phenomena in situ sampling
methods have limited utility for capturing the spatial and temporal variability
of snow and  ice processes  operational hydrology and climatology require
timely measurement of snowpack parameters

the redistribution of solar energy over the globe is central to studies in
climate  water serves a fundamental role in this redistribution through the
energy associated with evapotranspiration the transport of atmospheric water
vapor and precipitation  residence time for atmospheric water is on the order
of a week and for soil moisture from a couple of days to months which
emphasize the active nature of the hydrologic cycle  understanding the
importance of the landsurface hydrology to climate has  emerged as an
important research area since the mid 1960s when researchers  at the
geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory placed a land hydrology component 
into
their general circulation model gcm see manabe et al 1965 manabe
1969

as the sophistication of gcms has increased the role of the land  surface
component has become more and more important  however a major  weakness 
in
the current gcms is according to the ces89 report the  adequate
parameterization of variables representing the terrestrial phase of the
hydrologic cycle which is primarily the result of totally inadequate
information concerning the degree of spatial variability of  precipitation
evapotranspiration and other components of hydrology  this report goes
further to say the lack of regionalscale measurements  introduces a severe
shortcoming in the testing of gcm output 

perhaps the most important role that the land surface component of  a gcm
performs is the partitioning of incoming radiative energy into  sensible and
latent heat fluxes  the major factor involved in determining  the relative
proportions of the two heat fluxes is the availability of  water generally in
the form of soil moisture  a number of  modeling studies have demonstrated 
the
sensitivity of soil moisture  anomalies to climate walker and rowntree 1977
rowntree and bolton 1983  rind 1982 shukla and mintz 1982 delworth and
manabe 1989   researchers have reported for instance that soil moisture is
the  second most important forcing function second only to the sea surface
temperature in the mid latitudes and it becomes the most important forcing
function in the summer months  

the role of soil moisture is equally important at smaller scales recent
studies with mesoscale atmospheric models have similarly demonstrated a
sensitivity to spatial gradients of soil moisture  for example fast and
mccorcle 1991 have shown that soil moisture gradients can induce thermally
induced circulations similar to sea breezes  chang and wetzel 1991 have
concluded that the spatial variations of vegetation and soil moisture affect
the surface baroclinic structures through differential heating which in turn
indicate the location and intensity of surface dynamic and thermodynamic
discontinuities necessary to develop severe storms  in yet another study
lanicci et al 1987 have shown that dry soil conditions over northern mexico
and variable soil moisture conditions over the southern great plains can
dynamically interact to alter prestorm conditions and subsequent convective
rainfall patterns

it is still unclear whether the spatial distribution of soil moisture collected
at regional scales is useful for gcm and mesoscale modeling  one indication in
favor is the recent study by betts et al  1994 showing that initialization
of ecmwf weather predictions on current soil moisture during the summer of
1993 in the us great plains region can lead to improved rainfall predictions
the extreme wetness conditions in comparison to climatological average soil
moisture clearly was a factor in the effect  for more normal conditions soil
moisture anomalies will vary with the spatial and temporal scales of rain
eventsscales that may be meaningful to 4dimensional data assimilations
4dda and mesoscale modeling

based on these studies and scales ranging from gcm to mesoscale it appears
that soil moisture will be an important hydrologic variable for
hydrometeorological modeling and validation studies  because of the 
ubiquitous
nature of soil moisture in many disciplines there are numerous potential
science applications for frequent and spatially comprehensive measurements 
of
soil moisture  however most of these will fit under the umbrella of the
following four science issues which are the highest priority

	to understand the role of surface soil moisture in the partitioning of
incoming radiant energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes at a variety of
scales from mesoscale to gcm scale

	to understand the relationship between the surface 5 cm of soil 
moisture
observable by microwave techniques and the total profile 1 m or  more soil
moisture that is accessible to plants and transpiration to the atmosphere

	to understand how spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture are 
related
to the physical and hydrologic properties of soils

	to understand how the spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture 
can be
used to improve our ability to model runoff at a variety of scales and adapt
hydrologic models to areas of differing climate biomes and soils and
geology

with the potential for measuring soil moisture having been demonstrated the
obvious question to ask is how might society use such soil moisture
measurements  as in the science issues there are four general areas in 
which
routine measurements of soil moisture could have major impacts on our
daytoday lives

	improvements in medium range weather forecasting by incorporating 
measured
soil moisture on a 30km grid on a daily basis

	agricultural applications would include onfarm uses for improving 
irrigation
scheduling and efficiencies to improving crop yield modeling for both 
domestic
and foreign areas  the scales of interest here would be 100 m to 1 km and
three to seven days

	water management applications require better quantification of water 
uses
storages and runoff to monitor existing resources and to assist decision makers
in allocation of limited resources or coordination of relief efforts in times
of flooding  the scales of interest here would also be 100 m to 1 km and three
to seven days

	climate models particularly for annual and inter annual variability 
need to
be able to represent the land surface hydrologic processes accurately
measured soil moisture can be used as a state variable and as a validity
measure for gcms  the scales of interest here are 1 to 10 km and 7 to 30
days



role
of sar


satellite remote sensing has become increasingly important to hydrologists 
and
climatologists because the data provide information on the spatial and 
temporal
distributions of parameters of climatic and hydrologic importance snow 
covered
area surface albedo snow water equivalence and snow wetness liquid water
content for the seasonal snow cover remote sensing improves the 
monitoring
of existing conditions and has been incorporated into several
runoffforecasting and management systems visible and nearinfrared 
sensors
have been used extensively to measure snowcovered area while the signal in
this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is sensitive to snow grain size
and impurities it is not sensitive to wetness and is sensitive to water
equivalence only for shallow snow packs in addition cloud cover hampers 
data
collection from these sensors so the opportunities for obtaining suitable data
can be infrequent in addition to accurate measurements of snow extent and
albedo forecasting of melt at both continental and drainagebasin scales
requires information about spatial and temporal distributions of snow water
equivalence and free liquidwater content

passive microwave signals are sensitive to snow properties of hydrologic
interest however the spatial resolution of spaceborne passive microwave
sensors is much coarser than the natural scale of variation in mountainous
areas active microwave remote sensing has long promised the advantages of 
1
allweather day or night imaging capabilities 2 high resolution suitable for
alpine regions 3 sensitivity to most snow properties of interest to snow
hydrologists and climatologists over the last decade major improvements in
technology from data acquisition and processing to quantitative interpretation
have put capabilities for advanced snow and ice measurements at our 
doorstep

for snow recent studies using sircxsar airsar and ers1 data have 
shown
a significant improvement in understanding and modeling the backscattering 
and
polarization properties as a function of snowpack parameters an accurate
algorithm to retrieve snow wetness which indicates where and at what rate 
snow
is melting has been developed and tested using cband sir c and jpl airsar
data figures 33a <a
href=fig33bgif>33b thus accurate information about the
spatial and temporal distributions and melting status of snow cover can be
provided for hydrological and climatic investigations and operations maps of
snowcovered area derived from sircxsar and airsar now compare 
reasonably
well 8590 accuracy with those derived from visible imagery which 
require
clear weather and daylight

for soil moisture recent advances in remote sensing technology have
demonstrated that soil moisture can be measured by a variety of techniques
however only microwave technology has the ability to quantitatively measure
soil moisture under a variety of topographic and vegetation cover conditions
so potentially it could be extended to routine measurements from a satellite
system a number of experiments using sensors mounted in trucks aircraft 
and
spacecraft have shown that the moisture within a thin layer of soil on the
order of 5 cm  can be accurately measured for bare soil and thinly vegetated
surfaces

soil
moisture remote sensing


there are two basic microwave approaches that are typically used to measure
soil moisture  one is passive which is based on radiometry and the other is
active and uses radar both approaches utilize the large contrast between the
dielectric constant of dry soil and water at lband the dielectric constant
can vary from about 3 for dry soil to about 20 for wet soil which can result
in a change in emissivity for passive systems from about 095 to 06 or lower
and an increase in the radar backscatter approaching 10 db there are also
major differences between the two systems in spatial resolution swath width
data rate and power requirements however almost without exception the two
systems are complementary that
is strengths in one are matched by weaknesses in the other and vice versa
the advantages of passive microwave systems include frequent coverage low 
data
rates and relative to active microwave simpler data processing the
disadvantages include poor resolution in the case of the active microwave
systems the advantages include high resolution but this comes at the expense
of higher data rates and more complex processing

measurements show that the estimated soil moisture for lband frequencies
correlate best with soil moistures in the top 5 cm of the soil the sensitivity
of active microwave sensors to soil moisture was demonstrated with many 
ground
airborne and even some spaceborne experiments  ulaby and batlivala 1976
ulaby et al 1978 chang et al 1980 jackson et al 1981 wang et al
1986 dobson and ulaby 1986 lin et al 1994a b even though these
experiments have documented the sensitivity of the radar signal to soil
moisture algorithms to invert radar measurements to infer soil moisture oh 
et
al 1992 dubois et al 1994 must still be further evaluated over a broader
range of conditions

difficulties
in soil moisture remote sensing


a significant difficulty in remotely sensing soil moisture either with active
and passive systems  is the effect of target characteristics other than the
soil moisture for example surface roughness vegetation and topography  the
two most important target properties are surface roughness and those related 
to
the vegetation canopy  applying a backscattering model lin et al 1994
have studied the sensitivity of radar signals to various land surface
parameters specifically for lband 125 ghz  over a short grass canopy they
found that the most important parameter appears to be the surface roughness
in most natural settings the effect of roughness may be equal or greater than
the effect of soil moisture on the radar backscatter  thus the soil moisture
problem becomes one of determining the roughness effect independently so 
that a
model can be inverted to yield a soil moisture estimate

surface roughness effects  improved understanding of surface scattering
processes is needed to further our understanding of the role of surface
roughness in soil moisture estimation  thus theoretical surface
backscattering models have been developed for this purpose namely the 
small
perturbation model spm the physical optics model pom and
geometrical optics model gom  in a broad sense the geometrical optics model
is best suited for very rough surface the physical optics model is suitable
for surfaces with intermediate scales of roughness and the small perturbation
model is suitable for smooth surfaces  in general these models have not
provided good predictive values in fieldscale observed soil moisture and more
research is needed into surface scattering models  examples of recent work 
are
fung et al 1992 and oh et al 1992

the approach adopted by oh et al 1992 is based on scattering behavior in
limiting cases and on experimental data  they have developed an empirical
model in terms of the root mean square rms roughness height the wave 
number
and the relative dielectric constant  by using this model with multipolarized
radar data the soil moisture content and the surface roughness can be
determined  the key to this approach is that the copolarization ratios
hhvv and crosspolarization ratios hvvv which are given explicitly in
terms of the roughness and the soil dielectric constant  in more recent work
dubois et al 1995 an algorithm was derived that uses lband hh and vv
radar cross sections only to estimate surface roughness and soil moisture in
this case the algorithm was tested with both airborne and spaceborne sar 
data
and accuracies of 34 absolute was found for surfaces with vegetation that 
has
a normalized difference vegetation index ndvi < 04  thus initial
results look promising when applied to bare soil and sparse vegetation  but
current sar satellite sensors ers12 and radarsat are both
singlepolarization instruments cvv and chh respectively and even when
used together cannot provide crosspolarization ratios


vegetation effects  the effect of vegetation is to attenuate the microwave
emission from the soil it also adds to the total radiative flux with its own
emission the degree to which vegetation affects the determination of soil
moisture depends upon the wavelength the mass and water content of 
vegetation
and the vegetations structural characteristics as it influences its scattering
properties   thus with radar the effect of the vegetation canopy adds more
complexity to the problem  to infer soil moisture one must determine the soil
roughness effects and  the effects of the vegetation canopy which is a 
complex
inference problem and may not be unique without high temporal resolution 
data
in which only soil moisture is changing   as with the roughness case the
effect of vegetation on the active microwave sensing of soil moisture is
greatly dependent upon the instrument incidence angle frequency and
polarization the vegetation contains water along and has plant structure
radar backscatter is sensitive to both of these characteristics lin et al
1994a   therefore the radar backscatter from a vegetated surface will have
the integrated effect of the vegetation and underlying soil

two general approaches have been used to model the volume scattering the 
wave
approach and the intensity or radiative transfer approach both approaches
have their constraints especially in dealing with complex vegetation
structures several groups are involved in research in the area of estimating
soil moisture from active microwave data in the presence of vegetation few
results have been presented or published however saatchi et al 1994 
showed
that by using cband and lband data the canopy water content of grasses in
the konza prairie could be estimated with an accuracy of about 20 while lin
et al 1994 reported an accuracy of about 6 when estimating soil moisture
over grass covered areas in
england

assuming that the effects of vegetation could be accounted for in the case of
active microwave sensors and given the fact that the best resolution than
could be expected from a spaceborne low frequency radiometer is on the order 
of
tens of kilometers it is clear that sar can play an important role in
providing remotely sensed surface soil moisture maps the optimum radar
parameters based on the demonstrated algorithms would be a  polarimetric l
band
radar system with a resolution on the order of 100 m there is evidence that
suggests that inferring soil moisture in vegetated areas would require some
higher frequency sar data either cband or xband  continued research is
needed to help resolve the effectiveness of radar data for soil moisture under
different vegetation types and densities  one approach is using multi
temporal
data from a satellite platform which may provide the long term data sets
necessary to isolate the fastchanging soil moisture effects from the slowly
changing vegetation and roughness effects  another promising approach is
combining the sar radar measurements with a distributed hydrologic models 
to
infer soil moisture for example lin et al 1994b

field
measurements of soil moisture


when deciding the usefulness of the remote sensing instruments and the 
inferred
soil moisture estimates one has to take into account the natural spatial
variability of soil moisture thus when estimating the accuracy of a
technique estimated and in situ measured values are typically compared in
this way areal averages from the remotely sensed data are compared to point
measurements and the natural variation in the measured quantity becomes a 
very
important factor in judging the performance of a given technique

in most countries there are a number of insitu soil moisture measurements
taken in support of operational activities related to agriculture two examples
of such measurements programs are the illinois state us soil moisture
program an 18site measurement network in operation since 1981 and the 
long
term soil moisture measurements in the former soviet union and reported by
vinnikov and yeserkepova 1991 typically these measurements are taken 
using a
neutron probe time domain reflectivity td instrument or through
laborintensive techniques such as gravimetric measurements also typically
these are made on a threeday weekly or longer basis and in some cases for
agricultural experiments only during the growing season for example the
current illinois network makes biweekly samples during the growing season 
and
monthly samples at other times the data reported by vinnikov and 
yeserkepova
1991 were sampled at a monthly time interval

the insitu measurements generally provide good definition with depth 
usually
consisting of measurements every 5 or 10 cm throughout the root zone to 
depths
of one to two meters thus the profile is well defined but there is usually
not an extensive spatial sampling to detect soil moisture gradients in the
horizontal plane a number of investigators have looked into the spatial
variability of soil properties  rogowski 1972 found that over a range of
soils that the coefficient of variation in the distribution of water content at
15 bars was in the range of 15 to 35 and for experimental hydraulic
conductivity was 5 to 68 hawley et al 1982 investigated the effect of
sample volume on estimated soil moisture content using a 2m square plot and 
10
samples the estimated cv was in the range of 5 for the three different soil
moisture conditions investigated implying a cv of 1520 for a single sample
which is consistent with the other similar studies in addition they concluded
that samples greater than 200g 50 cc are needed for accurate estimates

field scale variability 16 ha > 40 acres was evaluated by bell et al
1980 using data collected in 57 fields in arizona kansas and south dakota
the nominal standard deviation of all the data analyzed was between 2 and 3
soil moisture for remote sensing studies this means that perfect correlations
to ground observations are unlikely and that the inherent error due to
fieldscale variability is of the same order of magnitude as the demonstrated
accuracies of the inversion results for both active and passive microwave
instruments

while there are direct uses for the surface soil moistures a much wider range
of research and applications would benefit from an estimate of the profile soil
moisture although there is still much work to be done in this area some basic
concepts have been proven kostov and jackson kostov 1993 have identified
four general approaches statistical knowledgebased a priori information
radiometric inversion and soil water modeling regional profile mapping 
using
a straightforward regression approach was demonstrated in jackson et al
1987 knowledgebased approaches have been used extensively by reutov 
and
shutko 1986 and 1990 and also by jackson 1980 recent research has 
focused
on a combination of the inversion and modeling approaches entekhabi et al
1994 each of these approaches needs to be considered in the development of
large scale mapping programs because any one in particular may not be
compatible due to limitations caused by ancillary data requirements or the
temporal and spatial sampling

radar
observations for soil moisture


sar satellites offer perhaps the best opportunity to measure soil moisture
routinely at regional scales  currently the ers1 cband vv and jers1
lband sars are operating and the canadian radarsat  also cband hh 
will
be launched in mid1995  although it is believed that an lband polarimetric
system would be optimal for soil moisture the preliminary results from the
ers1 demonstrate its capability as a soil moisture instrument under ideal
conditions bare soil near saturation constant roughness  the main drawback
to the sar systems is the lack of existing algorithms for the routine
determination of soil moisture  however through airborne and sirc remote
sensing experiments field observations are accumulating for a diverse set of
sites  it is hoped that these data are sufficient for developing suitable
algorithms  it is critical that these diverse data sets be brought together in
a sar soil moisture data base

experimental data sets can be grouped into three classes of which only one is
discussed in this report  these classes are i insitu operational soil
moisture data sets taken by water resources and agricultural agencies for a
variety of reasons  even though these data sets are important for hydrological
research the lack of simultaneous remote sensing data make these soil 
moisture
measurements of limited value for the development of soil moisture remote
sensing algorithms ii remote sensing experiments with passive microwave
sensors  examples of these include hapexmobilhy hydrologic atmospheric 
pilot
experiment and modelisation du bilan hydrique program in southern france 
in
1985 hapexsahel in niger west africa in 1992 and the first islscp field
experiment fife in kansas in 1987  iii remote sensing experiments with 
sar
and in some cases passive microwave sensors  these experiments include

machydro90 in the mahantango catchment central pennsylvania in 1990 
which
was a multisensor  campaign using the dc8 with the three frequency
polarimetric synthetic aperture radar sar and the c130 carrying  the 
pbmr
lband radiometer and the ns001 thematic mapper simulator

washita92 conducted over the little washita catchment in oklahoma in 1992
was another multisensor  campaign using the dc8 with the three frequency
polarimetric synthetic aperture radar sar and the c130 carrying the 
ns001
thematic mapper simulator the thermal imaging mapper the electronically
steered thinned array radiometer estar a 37ghz radiometer and a usda 
laser
profiler

maceurope91 a multiaircraft campaign dc8 and eu2 for remote sensing in
europe during 1991  soil moisture data were collected at a number of sites
including slapton wood devon england montespertoli tuscony italy efeda
experiment in spain

shuttle imaging radar sirc flights in april and october 1994  there were a
number of sites for which radar data were collected for soil moisture studies
these sites included the little washita ok usa mahantango catchment pa
usa alcona manitoba canada zwalm catchment belgium and 
montespertoli
italy

it is critical that these data be made available to provide algorithm
developers a broader range of soil moisture data



current
and planned sar assets and their use


several methods for mapping melting snowcovered regions have been  
developed
and tested using airsar and ers1 imagery mapping wet snow and glaciers 
in
remote alpine regions using a conventional singlepass singlepolarization 
sar
imagery requires an accurate digital elevation model dem but analysis of
timeseries ers1 data sets showed significant improvement in mapping 
accuracy
and corresponding decrease in the need for a dem however the capability of 
a
singlepolarization sar to study alpine snow is limited to map wet snow cover
only  furthermore multifrequency multipolarization sar can effectively 
map
the extent of wetsnow regions without requiring any topographic 
information
numerical simulations show that a similar technique could map dry snow 
cover
verification is ongoing thus a multifrequency polarized sar provides snow
mapping capability from small to large scales  sircxsar also can map firn
regions which indicates the regions of annual snow accumulation or of 
glacier
growth this capability provides an important tool for massbalance studies of
glaciers

the most fundamental snow cover property in terms of water supply 
forecasting
is the snowwater equivalence the total amount of water the snow would yield
at a  point if it melted this variable has been traditionally measured at
several hundred snow courses throughout the mountainous regions of the 
western
us how to extrapolate these widely dispersed measurements remains a
fundamental problem in estimating the total water volume in the mountains
numerical simulations with multifrequency dualpolarization sar have 
shown it
can monitor the spatial and temporal distributions of snowwater equivalence
data analysis with sircxsar is ongoing with accurate estimates of
snowcovered area detection of melting snow and the measurement of the
spatial distribution of snow water equivalence we will better understand the
most fundamental problems in snow hydrology the spatial and temporal
distributions of snow properties in alpine regions

to derive the maximum benefit in terms of research or application out of
remotely sensed soil moisture the remote sensing data must be integrated into
a geographic information system and analyzed taking into account the soil
properties and land characteristics  therefore the required resolution of the
remotely sensed soil moisture data is related to the intended usage and the
ancillary data bases available for interpretation  it makes little sense to
collect data globally at a resolution much higher than that of the ancillary
data  it therefore appears that based on the range of projected applications
and the available ancillary data bases that a spatial resolution on the order
of 100 m to 200 m may be advantageous for processing and interpretation  it is
true that the detail offered in higher resolution sar data is interesting
however it does not seem to be really needed except for mapping and other 
less
time critical analyses

the timing and frequency of observation are very important in the valuation 
of
the remote sensing data for application and analysis  surface soil moisture is
diurnal in nature generally decreasing during the day and rising slightly at
night in the absence of precipitation  the time of the observation will most
certainly be considered in its use  certain times of the day may offer certain
advantages  for instance to extrapolate a surface observation to the profile
using a physically based approach jackson 1980 has shown that a predawn
observation is advantageous  in fact late afternoon observations of surface
soil moisture using shorter wavelengths may provide little to no information
an improvement in this single observation could be made by utilizing diurnal
changes an am and a pm observation  for bare soils this could provide a
good estimate of the total surface flux during the day frequency of coverage
is a much more difficult subject  of course this too is dependent on the
application  it seems that daily coverage would be of greatest value for all
regions  there is a significant sacrifice in increasing this however the
next plateau would be three days  observations at lower frequencies might 
only
be of selected value 

given this sampling requirement and the previous experimental results it is
clear that the currently planned international sars can provide little beyond
change detection for changing moisture conditions and mapping of wet alpine
snow cover only  



recommendations

the recent results indicating that soil moisture and snow water equivalence
could indeed be measured accurately with spaceborne multiparameter sars 
bring
the remote sensing one step closer to providing some important variables to
help understand and routinely monitor the hydrologic cycle  however even
though the status of sar for measuring these quantities is very promising it
is recognized that there are a number of logical steps to be taken in order for
the general scientific and public communities to benefit from this research 


given the previous experimental results and the recent algorithms derived to
infer soil moisture and snow water equivalence it is clear that single
frequency sars can provide little beyond change detection for changing 
moisture
conditions  it is highly doubtful whether even the magnitude of the change 
in
the soil moisture could be quantified from these types of single parameter sar
measurements without a significant number of risky assumptions  therefore 
the
logical conclusion is that the ultimate goal should certainly be an operational
spaceborne multiparameter sar for routine soil moisture and snow water
equivalence mapping  recognizing that this is not likely to happen soon we
therefore urge the continued support of the nasa multiparameter airborne 
sar
program as a vehicle to continue the development and validation of soil
moisture snow wetness and snow water equivalence algorithms in the short 
term
with the long term goal the definition and launch of an operational sar to
monitor these important variables of the hydrologic cycle  below we outline a
few steps we consider necessary to achieve this goal

1	combine all data collected during airsar and sircxsar campaigns 
and
analyze their ability to determine soil moisture empirically sigma 0 vs
measured soil moisture and using all available algorithms  develop statistics
to define how large the errors are what type of errors and what conditions
the analysis or algorithms work or do not work well  using both us and 
foreign
campaigns should provide data from more than twenty sites and numerous
conditions

2	continue a vigorous research program to extend current algorithms to 
infer
soil moisture from vegetated surfaces and to refine the snow water 
equivalence
algorithms  the emphasis should be on well coordinated campaigns involving
both active and passive microwave instruments over a variety of different
terrain types

3	examine the relationship between surface measurements and profile
measurements of soil moisture to evaluate the severity of the problem if it
exists  data exist to address the following question  how well can the
profile moisture be modeled if the surface 5 cm of soil moisture can be
measured every 3 days at a precision of +4 by volume  what are the
performances of various models including simple regression models

4	encourage land process modelers mesoscale gcm and runoff to 
attempt to
use measured soil moisture and snow water equivalence from sircx and 
airsar
campaigns in their modeling
