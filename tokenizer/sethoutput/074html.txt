recovery and the art of movement
by mike santry

its good to be a seeker but sooner or later you have to be a
finder and then it is well to give what you have found a gift
into the world for whoever will accept it

jonathan livingston seagull

some people go through life seeking and never finding others
seek find and then assist others in their own quests

barbara mindell started her search shortly after a car crash at
the age of 18 left her a paraplegic while no one at the hospital
told her she would never walk again it was the impression she
was left with quoti never really bought the idea that id never
walkquot she says quotif there was a god there was a possibility
that i could recover from this injuryquot

conventional north american medical wisdom didnt have the answers
she was looking for quotdoctors think about the human body
as one would a car or a machine once grown it doesnt grow or
regenerate it eventually falls apart and they just fix the parts
along the wayquot she says mindell spent the next ten years
exploring the alternative healing methods including bodywork
massage and acupuncture she sent out 250 form letters to health
and scientific organizations around the world asking people to
work with her she received nothing more than good wishes in reply

in the course of her search mindell met emilie conraddaoud
and was introduced to continuumsomething she describes as quota
primary movement process which explores movement as something
we are rather than something we doquot conraddaoud invented
and developed this process which mindell says is an everchanging
everevolving inquiry into the nature of what it means to be a
human being

mindell learned from conraddaoud to breathe in a manner that
created a wavelike motion generated from the part of her body
that could move the wave motion radiates through the body spreading
tiny movements and signaling dormant areas to participate the
concept has been described as breaking ice to get to water
mindell suggests we entertain the notion that we are open systems
with endless possibilities for innovation and the development
of new neural pathways new connections new ways to identify
ourselves she describes her experience with the continuum as
having been a way to transform herself its like entering into
a new life shedding an old skinand doing it in a loving environment
she says

conraddaoud teaches that human beings develop in an aquatic
atmosphere while in the womb and are fundamentally aquatic beings
our earliest developments take place with movements similar to
those of the seafluttering irregular to the eye and experimental
undifferentiated movement wavemotion allows for nerves to innovate
and the more specific a movement is such as weight training
the less neural information there is in it the wave motion process
allows for aquaticlike movements within the body

as the neural information spreads from the wave motion probabilities
for new synaptic activity to be generated by hookups among the
thousands of neural signals traveling through the body develop
hookups between new neural pathways formerlyused muscles and
asyetunknown pathways for movement may also be created

mindell realized the healing had to come from within quotit
wasnt a process where the patient is passive and the other
person fixes themquot she says

quoti had a willingness to participate i was ready the spiritual
aspect of the healing for me was allimportant as i started to
get sensation as i started to move areas of my body that were
paralyzed showed me that movement and sensation were the result
of a much deeper process i went through a long process of letting
go of the struggling against the paralysis theres a lot of that
in living a life in a wheelchair forcing and pushing strugglingquot

mindell says she was able to become more general in her awareness
and not always focus on her legs and wanting to walk quotits
really not a process of dealing directly with the issue its
much more expansive in any transformation process you cant
be overly focused on paralysis it creates more of the samea
loop so for myself in this process it hasnt been just healing
the paralysis its more than just thatspiritual growth development
being able to have a full life have a career as an artist being
in a relationship and being able to move in many different ways
through this process the increase in sensation has been enormous
the feeling of fluidity and movement in my body has been an incredible
healingquot

although not quite ambulatory mindell now has sensation and
movement throughout her lower body her investigation into movement
has led to profound insights into the creative capacity of our
biological systems and has farreaching implications for the healing
community to all of us paralysed in various ways she is an example
of what a body can be

based on a interview by grant maclean

barbara mindell will be speaking on moving through paralysis on
friday oct 4 and conducting a workshop entitled the art of
movement in vancouver october 56 at the holiday inn 1110 howe
street preregistration is required contact doris maranda 604
