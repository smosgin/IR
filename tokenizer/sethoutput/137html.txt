abstract

this paper presents the climatology of the east asian winter monsoon
and cold surges based on the 19791995 ncepncar reanalysis in addition
to documenting the frequency intensity and preferred propagation tracks
of cold surges and the evolution patterns of associated fields the temporal
distribution of the siberian high and cold surges is discussed further
this study examines the interannual variation of the winter monsoon and
cold surges and its relationship with enso 

there are on average thirteen cold surges in each winter season october
to april of which two are strong cases the averaged intensity of cold
surges measured by maximum surface pressure is 1053 hpa the cold surges
originate from two primary source regions 1 northwest of lake baikal
and 2 north of lake balkhash the typical evolution of a cold surge occurs
over the period of 514 days trajectory and correlation analyses indicate
that during this time high pressure centers propagate southeastward around
the edge of the tibetan plateau from the mentioned source regions some
of these high pressure centers then move eastward and diminish over the
ocean while others proceed southward the signature of the associated
temperature wind and pressure fields propagate farther southward and
eastward the affected area encompasses the bulk of the maritime continent
although the intensity of the siberian high is found to peak during december
and january the frequency of cold surges has a maximum in november and
in march this result suggests that november through march should be considered
as the east asian winter monsoon season 

two stratifications of cold surges are used to examine the relationship
between enso and the interannual variation of the winter monsoon the first
one described as the conventional cold surges indicates that the cold
surge frequency reaches a minimum a year after el nino events the second
one defined as the maximum wind events near the south china sea shares
the same source regions as the first this stratification of surges is
found to be in good agreement with the southern oscillation index soi
low soi high soi events coincide with high low frequencies of cold
surges

the interannual variation of averaged meridional wind near the south
china sea and the maritime continent is dominated by the south china sea
cold surges and is also well correlated r=082 with the soi strong
wind seasons are associated with la nina and high soi events likewise
weak wind years are linked with el nino and low soi cases this pattern
is restricted north of the equator within the region of 0degn20degn
110dege130dege and is confined to the near surface layer the surface
siberian high 500 hpa trough and 200 hpa jetstream all representing the
largescale monsoon flow are found to be weaker than normal during el
nino years in particular the interannual variation of the siberian high
is in general agreement with the soi

1 introduction

the east asian winter monsoon which is associated with a strong siberian
high and active cold surges is one of the most energetic monsoon circulation
systems the dramatic shift of the northeasterlies and the outbreak of
cold surges dominate the winter weather and climate in the east asian region
the winter monsoon and cold surges exert a strong impact on the extratropical
and tropical planetaryscale circulations chang and lau 1982 and influence
the ssts in the tropical western pacific chang et al 1979 their general
characteristics and the possible linkage between cold surges and tropical
atmospheric and oceanic phenomena have been examined in many studies for
example chang and lau 1982 showed that the outbreak of winter monsoon
surges forced short term changes in the hadley and walker circulation
the east asian jetstream and largescale deep convection over the equatorial
western pacific boyle 1986a 1986b found that the frequency and intensity
of the monsoon surges for a given month were related to the intensity of
the east asian jetstream and the extratropical largescale circulation
patterns lau and chang 1987 suggested that the interannual variations
of the winter monsoon and cold surges may be related to enso and tropical
intraseasonal oscillations ding and krishnamurti 1987 noted an eastward
shift of the tropical planetary scale divergent circulation in association
with the cold surges which was very similar to the shift of the divergent
circulation between el nino and la nina years

however little attention has been given to the climatological aspects
of the winter monsoon and cold surges boyle and chang 1984 documented
the mean winter circulation statistics based on the navy fleet numerical
oceanography centers fnoc gridded analyses pan et al 1985 compiled
the statistics of the siberian high and cold air outbreaks in china with
emphasis on the effect to local weather forecast ding and krishnamurti
1987 summarized the climatological tracks of cold surges based on the
data from the winter djf of 1980 to 1984 although the winter monsoon
was much weaker than normal during the 198283 el nino event lau and chang
1987 there has never been a systematic investigation on the relationship
between enso and the interannual variation of the winter monsoon and cold
surges

the purpose of this study is to present the climatology of cold surges
and the siberian high based on the 19791995 ncepncar reanalysis we emphasize
the temporal and spatial distribution of the cold surges and the siberian
high their origin propagation paths and evolution patterns of particular
interest is the interannual variation of winter monsoon and cold surges
given that the winter monsoon activity was weaker during the 198283 period
one of our goals is to determine if a consistent relationship exists between
enso and the interannual variation of the winter monsoon and cold surges

2 nbspdescription of the reanalysis

we use twicedaily surface and upperair fields from the ncepncar reanalysis
kalnay et al 1996 for the period of 19791995 the surface quantities
include temperature wind and sealevelpressure slp upperair fields
are winds at 925 hpa 850 hpa 700 hpa and 200 hpa and geopotential height
at 500 hpa the advantage of this data set is that the reanalysis used
a quotfrozenquot stateoftheart analysisforecast system to perform
the data assimilation throughout the whole period thus circumventing problems
with previous numerical weather prediction analyses due to changes in techniques
models and data assimilation also this dynamically consistent reanalysis
offers good horizontal 25deg x 25deg and vertical resolution 17

3 winter monsoon circulation

31nbsp mean state

the winter monsoon circulation has been documented by many authors eg
boyle and chang 1984 lau and li 1984 lau and chang 1987 boyle and chen
1987 and is summarized here to serve as a background for this paper the
dominant surface feature of the winter monsoon is the siberian high the
winter slp averaged from 197980  199495 is shown in fig
1 this surface pressure system with central pressure in excess of
1036 hpa covers the entire east asian continent and yields northeasterly
flow over a large part of asia at 500 hpa the flow pattern is dominated
by the coastal trough the intensity of this trough is quasigeostrophically
linked to the surface siberian high at 200 hpa the most prominent feature
is the east asian jet near japan this jet the strongest on the globe
is associated with intense baroclinicity large vertical wind shear and
strong cold advection it is maintained by the coriolis torque acceleration
exerted on the ageostrophic wind near the jet entrance region its strength
is inherently related to the intensity of the surface siberian high and
the 500 hpa trough these features characterize the threedimensional largescale
monsoon circulation 

fig 1 also presented the winter djf surface
wind averaged from 197980  199495 this climatological surface wind
represents contributions from both the quasistationary siberian high and
the cold surges north of 30degn the wind blows along the north and
east periphery of the siberian high this anticyclonic flow pattern is
a reflection of the quasistationary pressure system south of 30degn
where the siberian high pressure exerts less influence the wind maximum
near the south china sea can be largely attributed to the cumulative effects
of the cold surges one of the main features of this field is that the
westerly flow near japan bifurcates the eastward branch merges with the
aleutian low the southern branch joins the tradewind belt cold air intensity
and thickness usually reduce significantly as the airmass moves southward
thus the winter monsoon is a shallow phenomenon in lower latitudes

32 variance of slp and surface air temperature

the standard deviation of slp in fig 2 a indicates
that the siberian high pressure is a rather stationary feature of the winter
monsoon the largest variations occur to the northwest of the siberian
high and to the east where the variability near the aleutian low dominates
although the standard deviation of temperature is largest at high latitudes
as indicated in fig 2 b substantial variability
also occurs over eastern china this is noticed as a pronounced southward
extension of the standard deviation over this region a similar but less
well defined southward extension is also seen in the variability of slp
the southward extensions in both variables is an indication of the cold
surge activity

figs 2 c and d show the
percent of total variance of slp and surface air temperature explained
by periods of 614 days the typical lifetime of cold surges along the
east coast of china over 25 of the total variance of surface air temperature
and slp occurs on time scales of 614 days the structure of the temperature
variation exhibits more regionality than that of slp and has a pronounced
signal over eastern china power spectra of the surface air temperature
and slp in this vicinity exhibits many common spectral peaks on these time
scales not shown suggesting a close association between the temperature
and slp variation in this region which is consistent with the characteristics
of cold surges the substantial slp variance over the pacific ocean near
25degn and the one northward over japan are not necessarily associated
with cold surge activity these variation maxima are intriguing features
of the slp which will be investigated in future works cold air activity
over the east asia continent and the south china sea will be of interest
here

4 cold surges and siberian high

the cold surges are the most important transient disturbances embedded
within the mean monsoon circulation the occurrence of a cold surge is
characterized by a southward movement of a surface anticyclone and an associated
abrupt 2448 hours surface air temperature drop in the affected regions
the typical scenario of a cold air outbreak is the siberian high and the
coastal trough reach a certain intensity further west over the continent
an upper level short wave undergoes strong development as it moves eastward
eventually the short wave develops into a major trough and replaces the
old quasistationary coastal trough during this process a surface anticyclone
moves southward and a cold surge occurs staff members of academia sinica
1957 it should be pointed out that the buildup and maintenance of the
siberian high pressure is a necessary condition for the occurrence of cold
surges radiative cooling persistent cold air advection usually blocking
over urals throughout the troposphere and largescale descending motion
all contribute to the maintenance of the cold siberian high ding and krishnamurti1987
however cold surges should not be regarded as the simple southward expansion
or temporal variability of the siberian highs rather it is of a separate
dynamical entity the siberian high and the cold surge are the two most
characteristic weather phenomena of the winter monsoon the relationship
between the two will be further discussed in section 42

41 criteria for cold surges

objective criteria to identify the cold surges are required in this
study many cold surge definitions can be found in the literature a summary
of the often used definitions is given in boyle and chen 1987 some of
the cold surges are purposely defined for the convenience of weather forecasting
definitions vary depending on regions of interest for example cold surges
defined over the south china sea may have nothing to do with cold surges
defined near korea the essence of the cold surges as mentioned above
is the rapid southsoutheastward movement of a surface anticyclone which
brings significant surface air temperature drop in the affected regions

in defining a cold surge from the reanalysis we choose to average the
necessary fields at particular regions which encompass a ninegridpoint
rectangular at the 25deg x 25deg resolution see
fig 3 region 1 is in southern siberia region 2 is in the middle
of china and region 3 covers part of southern china using information
from these regions we define a cold surge as follows

1 outbreak requires a a surface anticyclone must be identified criteria
in zhang and wang 1996 in the vicinity of region 1 which has an averaged
slp gt1035 hpa and b during the movement of a surface anticyclone
the 2448 hour surface air temperature drop must exceed 9degc in region
2 or 6degc in region 3

2 ending of a cold surge occurs when a a negative pressure tendency
at the anticyclone center has persisted for 24 hours and the center pressure
is lt1025 hpa and b positive surface temperature trend was found over
50 of the grid points in the bulk of the east asia continent 1025dege1175dege
25degn50degn 

a cold surge is chosen when these criteria are met the thresholds
mostly based on synoptic experience can be altered within a certain range
despite this the overwhelming majority of surges will still be identified
because the key characteristics of cold surges are represented by these
criteria also since a cold surge affects large areas of east asia in
temperature and pressure fields it is unlikely that a nonsurge event
will be identified as a surge

in order to verify the identified cold surges time series of surface
air temperature in regions 1 2 and 3 t1 t2 and t3 of the 198788
winter are plotted in fig 4 according to the criteria
if a surface anticyclone has reached a certain intensity a required drop
in either t2 or t3 will qualify the disturbance to be a cold surge all
the observed cold surges during this seasonknown from other sourceswere
found to be associated with a temperature drop in region 2 or region 3
fig 4 illustrates how quickly the temperature can drop in a specific location
and its southward propagation one of the strongest cold surges ever observed
occurred during late november of 1987 the recorded maximum surface pressure
is in excess of 1081 hpa the temperature drops are ~ 15degc in all three
regions 

the timing duration and frequency of cold surges identified using
this criteria are further compared with those defined operationally by
the beijing meteorological center bmc for the period 197984 the period
for which the data from bmc are available and good agreement were found
between the two thus we have confidence that the cold surge definition
is appropriate given the verification provided from in situ observations

42 statistics trajectories and spatial
evolution of cold surges

based on the above criteria over 200 cold surges have been identified
during the 197995 period table 1 gives the average frequency intensity
and duration for cold surges and strong cold surges strong cases are defined
as events that are associated with temperature drop gt10degc and northerly
wind gt 4 m s1 in region 3 by the addition of this wind criterion
the strong cases are assured to be cold surges that exert impacts in the
tropical region the average maximum center pressure is ~1060 hpa for strong
surges and it is ~ 1053 hpa for all cold surges lifetimes of individual
surges range from 5  14 days with an average duration of ~7 days for
cold surges and ~ 9 days for strong events

the trajectories of the surface anticyclones associated with each of
the cold surges are shown in fig 5 the circles indicate
the original location of the high pressure center and the squares denote
the termination points based on the trajectories cold surges tend to
originate from two distinct regions the first is located northwest of
lake baikal near 95dege105dege 45degn60degn and the second
is to the north of lake balkhash and near 75dege90dege 52degn60degn
all the surges propagate southward or southeastward over eastern china
some of them ended in the east china sea and coastal regions while others
propagate further south 

although the cold surge trajectories terminated around 30degn the
pressure temperature and meridional wind perturbations are observed further
south this is indicated in fig 6 the climatological
evolution of cold surge associated slp temperature and northerly wind
for each winter 120 days midnovember through midmarch daily values
of t3 are lag correlated with each of these fields at each lag the average
correlation from all 16 winters is calculated since a cold surge is associated
with a decrease in temperature the sign convention is such that 1 a negative
correlation with slp indicates high pressure 2 a positive autocorrelation
with surface air temperature indicates low temperature and 3 a positive
correlation with the meridional wind indicates enhanced northerlies correlations
for |r| 02 are contoured this corresponds to the 95 confidence level
for 100 independent time samples while estimating the actual number of
degrees of freedom is problematic the correlation cutoff used is very
conservative given that 120 time points in each of 16 years of data were
used giving the potential of 1918 degrees of freedom 16 x 1202

at day 4 a massive high pressure covers most of siberia and temperatures
are below normal however the signal in the meridional wind is weak at
best the centers of action in the surface air temperature and the slp
are located near mongolia 95dege 50degn at this time it is of interest
to note the presence of significantly below normal slp in the vicinity
of the maritime continent this indicates the presence of a northsouth
gradient of slp prior to the southward migration of the cold air and enhanced
northerlies two days later these centers of action have shifted southeastward
and the correlations have become stronger the signal in the vwind also
strengthens with the maximum northerlies located to the east of the slp
and temperature signals by day 0 the cold air and pressure surge have
spilled southward along the eastern flank of the tibetan plateau with
the strongest correlations located over region 3 by day +2 the cold surges
have progressed further south with the centers of action located over
southeastern china the signal in the vwind is located even further south
with the strongest correlation 05 near 110dege 5degn even on day
+4 there still remains a close correspondence between the slp and temperature
centers having now progressed to the southwest the vwind signature remains
intact over the south china sea with the maximum correlation located on
the equator at 105dege the deeper intrusion of the northerlies into
the tropics than either the slp or temperature signature is a consistent
feature during individual years when the correlations may be even stronger

the eastward extension is also a robust feature although may not appear
as significant as the southward component this is because the anticyclones
that travel to the east unlike those to the south are subject to immediate
and strong deformation by the warm and moist marine boundary once they
reach the east coast cold surges that ended in the vicinity of the east
china sea belong to this category and comprise a substantial number of
total cold surges see fig 5 the patterns of lag
correlations of t2 with temperature slp and surface wind are found to
be very similar to those presented in fig 6 not
shown 

the frequency intensity regionality trajectory and propagation patterns
of the cold surges presented above have extended and substantiated the
results of previous studies staff member of academia sinica 1957 zhu
et al 1981 ding and krishnamurti 1987 they are also consistent with
the annual cold surge summaries of bmc 1990

43 temporal distribution of cold surges
and siberian high 

figs 7 a and b give
the monthly cold surge events and the number of days that the siberian
high central pressure is greater than 1050 hpa the intensity of the siberian
high tends to peak in december and january however the cold surge frequency
exhibits maxima in november and march this result contradicts with the
wellaccepted close relationship between the intensity of the siberian
high and occurrence of cold surges ding 1994 both dynamical and thermodynamical
reasons can be attributed to this 

first the east asian largescale flow is usually in a lowindex mode
during the regime transition period of november and march zhu et al
1979 in december and january however the usual highindex largescale
flow is characterized by a strong siberian high and an intense jetstream
this pattern is unfavorable for the occurrence of cold surges despite the
abundance of cold air during this time this is because that the short
waves tend to move rapidly through such a pattern without causing any disturbances
boyle 1986a the low index flow background on the other hand typically
has a blocking over the asian continent and deep troughing along the coast
this flow pattern yields a northwesterly flow over lake baikal which is
highly unstable and more ready to release potential energy when triggered
by a short wave boyle 1986a 

secondly an important criterion of a cold surge is the 2448 hour surface
air temperature drop during december and january the jetstream is further
south and the surface air temperature is relatively lower as such it
takes a very strong anticyclone to induce a substantial temperature change
in a cold background while the surface air temperature is relatively warmer
during november and march cold air and anticyclones with modest intensity
can significantly reduce the surface air temperature from the view of
weather forecasters it is the cold surges that occur during november and
march that yield a more abrupt temperature drop have the most significant
damaging effect on local agriculture and economy 

recently a very similar monthly distribution of cold surges has been
found by ding and collaborators based on cold surges from 6 winters ding
personal communication 1996 they suggest that the warm and moist troughs
that moving out of the bay of bengal result in the relatively lower frequency
cold surges during december and january 

as mentioned before one of the necessary conditions of cold surge outbreak
is that the siberian high reaches a certain intensity but this is by no
means guarantee that the cold surge frequency should monotonically increase
as the siberian high intensifies the statistics based on the 17year data
shown here and dings recent results do not support quotthe higher the
siberian high pressure the greater the possibility of cold surge occurrence
quotding 1994 a statement that has been mistakenly known in the forecasting
community 

the temporal distribution of strong cold surges is examined of all
the 26 strong cases identified 20 of them occurred in december january
and february and five in november only one in march and none during october
or april the strong cold surges tend to occur during very cold months
this suggests that large surface pressure gradient associated with a very
strong surface anticyclone and abundant sources of cold air is an important
driving force to push the cold air far into the tropics this result also
suggests that the intensity of the siberian high may be related to the
occurrence of strong cold surges that affect the tropical regions because
the cold surge frequency is high in november and march and the prevailing
northeasterly wind dominates a large area of east asia during these months
november through march ndjfm should be the months for studying the east
asian winter monsoon and cold surges rather than december through february
djf which the majority of winter monsoon studies has emphasized

5 interannual variation

in order to investigate the possible linkage between the interannual
variation of the east asian winter monsoon and enso the 19791995 winter
average southern oscillation index is plotted in fig
8 although the southern oscillation is not a standing phenomenon
the evolution of monsoon circulation during enso phases is ignored given
that the winter monsoon is not examined on a monthly basis the two major
el nino events of 198283 and 198687 exhibit low soi negative departures
of the soi also occur during the 198990 and 199192 seasons the 198889
la nina event has soi in excess of 2 hpa 

51 cold surges

the annual cold surge frequency is first examined an interesting feature
in fig 9 is that minimum frequency events occurs
one year after the el nino years to test the robustness of this result
we investigated the sensitivity of the cold surge frequency to the slp
threshold in the cold surge definition aside from an expected decline
in cold surge frequency with a stricter slp criterion the interannual
variations were found to be insensitive further the cold surge frequency
from bmc during 19801984 shows the same variation pattern as in fig 9
data from bmc also indicates that cold surge frequency reaches a minimum
one year after the 195758 and 196566 el nino events this phenomenon
agrees with the 1~15 year lag response of the northeast china surface
air temperature to the sst near the eastern equatorial pacific suggested
by bao et al 1989 

as mentioned earlier the definition of a cold surge is regionally dependent
the cold surges identified above which are in good agreement with the
observations from bmc typically influence the bulk of east asia and the
coastal regions however a subset of these cold surges can reach to the
south china sea this is illustrated in figs 10 a
and b time series of meridional wind in three
regions for the 198788 season along with region 1 slp the phases of
slp variation are exactly reversed to those of region 3 meridional wind
which are followed chronologically by the similar variation patterns near
taiwan and in the vicinity of the south china sea the lags between the
variation patterns in each region which represent the southeast propagation
of the surface anticyclones are around 13 days 

the typical synoptic scenario of the propagation is as follows before
the outbreak of a cold surge the intensification of the siberian high
simultaneously strengthens the northeasterly flow near region 3 the outbreak
of the cold surge pushes the anticyclonic flow southeastward and increases
the notherlies near taiwan region the wind then subsequently penetrated
further into the northern part of the south china sea and the cold surge
ended according to the weather forecasters li personal communication
1996 of hainan island 18degn 110dege whether a cold surge will
affect the island and the surrounding oceans depends on its path and intensity
when this region is under the influence of a cold surge the most conspicuous
weather phenomenon is the strong northeasterly wind the seven strong wind
events northerly wind gt 7 msec near the south china sea in the 198788
season as indicated in fig 10 a is a subset
of the eleven cold surges identified during the season strong wind events
for other years are also examined not shown we found that with on exception
every event is associated with a cold surge outbreak from the extratropics

because the surface meridional wind is the most important indicator
of the cold surge activity in hainan area we define the south china sea
cold surge as the number of days that maximum northerly wind gt 7 ms
in the region of 10degn20degn110dege120dege similar definition
has been used by chang and chen 1992 based on this definition the south
china sea cold surge frequency is shown in fig 11
the interannual variation of cold surge frequency is in good agreement
with the pattern of soi correlation coefficient = 085 low cold surge
frequencies coincide with el nino and low soi events high frequencies
accompany with la nina and high soi years this agrees with observed strong
wind record of hainan island li personal communication 1996 for winters
of 19501980 which indicates that cold air activity is much reduced during
the years of 195758 196566 196869 and 197273 all are el nino events

52 mean meridional wind

frequency of the south china sea cold surges not only bears good relationship
with the soi but also largely controls the meridional wind variation over
the south china sea and over even larger areas fig
12 shows time series of mean meridional wind for increasingly larger
regions the patterns in all the three regions are similar to that of the
soi in agreement with the cold surges stronger northerlies occur during
la nina and high soi seasons and weaker northerlies occur during el nino
and low soi years the correlation coefficient between the soi and the
meridional wind in the south china sea 10degn20degn110dege120dege
is 082 by examining the same time series as in fig 12 but over many
ninegridpoint rectangular boxes near the western pacific we found that
this soilike pattern of the wind does not exist in any of the areas outside
the region of 0degn20degn100dege130dege 

the meridional wind variation is a shallow phenomenon occurring primarily
at the surface this is demonstrated in fig 13 where the wind variations
near the south china sea are plotted at the 925 hpa and 850 hpa levels
although the patterns at both levels still bear certain resemblance to
that of the soi the biennial oscillation is the dominant mode at 700
hpa and above not shown the geostrophic flow is decidedly zonal over
the entire east asian continent and the wind in the northern part of the
south china sea is under great influence of the split jetstream south of
the tibetan plateau the signature of the soi has been totally lost clearly
this soilike wind pattern is horizontally restricted within the region
of 0degn20degn100dege130dege and vertically confined to the
near surface layer 

based on the above discussions it is clear that the variation of area
averaged meridional wind near the south china sea and the maritime continent
hinges on the variation of the south china sea cold surges the south china
sea cold surges share the same origin as the conventionally defined cold
surges the area averaged meridional wind near the south china sea is thus
greatly controlled by the northerlies propagated from the extratropics

53 largescale features 

as mentioned earlier the surface siberian high 500 hpa trough and
the 200 hpa jetstream characterize the winter monsoon largescale circulation
and their strength are inherently related to each other 

fig 14 presents the number of days that the central
pressure is greater than 1050 hpa in the region of 45degn55degn
90dege110dege although this is not the only measure of the siberian
high intensity the broad aspect of the interannual variation of this measure
agrees with the soi the variation patterns indicate that in general
the siberian high is stronger weaker in la nina el nino and high low
soi years the mean meridional wind averaged over the southeast periphery
5degn20degn 160dege180dege of the siberian high another way
to represent the intensity of the high pressure shows exactly the same
result as that of fig 14 not shown 

the variation of the 500 hpa geopotential height anomaly along 135dege
is calculated although the overall variation pattern not shown is not
comparable with the soi the 500 hpa trough is weaker during 198283 198687
and 199192 el nino events the 200 hpa east asian jet is also examined
although this jet is subject to propagation or expansion in the eastwest
direction during different phases of enso the jet intensity at 140dege
is found abnormally weak during all three major el nino events not shown
this result is consistent with the weak siberian high and 500 hpa trough

overall the largescale monsoon circulation is weaker than normal during
all the three major el nino events in particular the variation pattern
of the siberian high generally agrees with the soi

6 summary and discussion

the study of the east asian winter monsoon and cold surges from the
19791995 ncepncar reanalyses has revealed and extended several noteworthy
climatological features of the winter monsoon according to the conventional
cold surge criteria about 13 cold surges occur every winter season of
which two are strong cases that influence the tropical region the average
lifetime of the cold surges is about 7 days and the average intensity of
highs is 1053 hpa the strong cases usually last for about 9 days with
average intensity of 1060 hpa

the cold surges tend to originate from two source regions one is near
the northwest of lake baikal and the other is to the north of lake balkhash
the high pressure centers propagate southeastward and end in the east
and southeast of china and surrounding oceans consistent with trajectories
of pressure centers correlation patterns indicate that the signature of
associated slp surface wind and surface air temperature stretches further
south and east the southward extent includes the bulk of the maritime
continent the eastward extent reaches 150dege 

although the intensity of the siberian high varies according to the
season and reaches its peak in january the cold surges are most active
during november and marchthis result suggests that november through march
should be considered as the east asian winter monsoon season it also indicates
that the occurrence of cold surges does not monotonically increase with
the strengthening of the siberian high an empirical rule that has been
widely believed in the forecasting community examination of monthly distribution
of strong cold surges indicates however that the majority of strong cold
surges occurs during djf this result suggests that large pressure gradient
associated with strong siberian high is an important driving force to push
the cold air far into the tropics

the two stratifications of cold surges are revealing when considering
the relationship between enso and the interannual variation of the cold
air activity the first stratification as described in the cold surge
identification criteria yields result that is consistent with the in situ
observation from bmc the interannual variation of cold surge frequency
shows that minimum surge frequency occurs one year after an el nino event
the second stratification based on the maximum meridional wind event in
the south china sea indicates that the interannual variation of the south
china sea cold surge is in good agreement with the soi high cold surge
frequency is found during la nina and high soi events low frequency is
associated with el nino and low soi events 

the variation of the mean meridional wind near the south china sea and
tge narutune hinges on the south china sea cold surges as in the case
of the cold surges the interannual variation of the wind is also well
correlated with the soi strong wind years are associated with la nina
and high soi events weak wind years are found during el nino and low soi
events this pattern of variation is restricted north of the equator within
0degn20degn100dege130dege and confined to the near surface
layer the interannual variation of the siberian high measured by means
of both pressure and wind is in general agreement with the soi both the
strength of the 200 hpa jetstream and the 500 hpa trough are found to be
weaker than normal during el nino events although their interannual variation
patterns do not agree with the soi as closely as that of the siberian high

given the close relationship between the soi and the interannual variation
of the monsoon meridional wind and cold surges it is natural to wonder
why some of the monsoon related disturbances either originated from or
located in the extratropics exhibit variation patterns similar to the
soi and what are the physical mechanisms between the ensowinter monsoon
interaction 

during a typical el nino year the convective activity in the maritime
continent is usually reduced if the cumulus convection in this region
is one of the most important monsoon energy sources as suggested by ramage
1971 the suppression of the maritime convection should be responsible
at least partly for the weaker than normal extratropical monsoon circulation
during el nino events with the available observed outgoing longwave radiation
olr data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration we
have computed the olr anomaly in the maritime continent 110dege120dege
5degn5degs from 19791992 the overall interannual variation pattern
not shown here is not as close to the soi as that of the south china
sea cold surges or the siberian high however negative anomaly is found
during the 198889 la nina season likewise positive olr anomalies are
found during the 198283 and 198687 el nino seasons the correlation coefficient
between the olr anomaly and the soi is |r|=05

on the other hand evidence indicated that the winter monsoon and cold
air activity can greatly affect the tropical convective activity and sst
slingo 1996 personal communication found that indonesian convection
is enhanced when cold surges penetrated far into the tropics chang et
al 1979 have shown that cold surges are capable of influencing the tropical
sst but whether the cold surges can significantly affect the tropical
region as has been discussed depends on the intensity and path of the
cold surges it may also relate to the background largescale circulation
theoretical studies have suggested branstator 1983 lau and lim 1984
that the interaction between the tropical convection and midlatitude circulation
depends critically on the relative position of the convection and extratropical
quasistationary waves it has also been suggested that the interaction
between cold surges and convective activities near the maritime continent
will in turn modify the extratropical and tropical synoptic and planetary
scale circulations chang and lau 1980 apparently further studies are
much needed to delineate the mechanism of the interaction between the winter
monsoon and convection near the maritime continent

in summary in addition to extend and substantiate the climatological
aspects of the east asian winter monsoon and cold surges the current study
has clearly indicated that the interannual variation of the south china
sea cold surges is in good agreement with the soi the south china sea
cold surges share the same origin with the conventionally defined cold
surges they also dominate the variation of the area averaged meridional
wind near the south china sea and the western pacific the conventionally
defined cold surges on the other hand reached minimum frequencies one
year after el nino events largescale monsoon circulations are found to
be weaker than normal during el nino years however physical mechanisms
responsible for the interaction between enso and the winter monsoon are
still not well understood especially problems on if and how the winter
monsoon cold air activity affects the enso through its impact on tropical
sst pattern and convective activities in the maritime continent simulations
of coupled ocean models and gcm simulations with specified observed sst
such as simulations from the atmospheric model intercomparison project
amip should provide a good opportunity to address these problems
