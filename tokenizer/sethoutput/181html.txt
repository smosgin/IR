late1995 signposts point way toward industry trends of 1996

executive summary  from interviews with industry leaders and analysis
of recent events it is possible to connect some of the dots and make
educated guesses about what 1996 holds in store for wireless

     the way larry vanston sees it the year ahead will be a lot like
95 in the world of wireless telecommunications  this is to say that
1996 will be another year of recordsetting growth heightened
competition and rapid technological change for the industry
according to vanston president of austin texasbased consultants
technology futures inc
     vanston and other observers surveyed by wbf said it may well be
that the industry is in for a year when the pace of developments if
anything gains more momentum  such an acceleration is seen occurring
across a broad frontmanifested by prices for services driven lower
as more competitors arrive on the scene and by a stream of
technological advancesand against a backdrop where wireless
telephony becomes a widespread reality in more markets overseas
     but this is not to say that there are no clouds on the wireless
horizon  indeed renewed signs of a slowdown in the us cellular
marketthe worlds largest in terms of absolute subscribershave
dampened the growth outlook for network operators and for handset and
infrastructure manufacturers 
     as nokia corp noted dec 14 despite improvement in nokias
us mobile phone business growth and profitability in nokia mobile
phones have developed somewhat below plan  that sent the price of
nokias american depositary receipts tumbling for the second time in
two months page 9  
     however it was unclear at press time whether handset
manufacturers in general faced a repeat of the overages that built up
in their us inventories during the 1994 christmas season
     all the same wall streeters are a notoriously fickle bunch and
any falloff in domestic wireless growth should be measured against
the blistering expansion that the us market enjoyed during 1994 and
the first half of 1995  net subscriber additions simply could not be
sustained forever at such an explosive rate and cellulars longterm
growth pattern seems firmly intact 
     by the end of 1996 it is conceivable that there will be 40
million cellular subscribers in the united statesa gain of 10
million in a 15month span

  all eyes turn to pcs

     big changes are destined to sweep the us wireless market this
year as the industry comes to grips with the probable enactment of
legislation aimed at deregulating telecommunications  this would give
network operators the statutory certainty they need to move forward
with big purchases of new equipment said matthew flanagan president
of the telecommunications industry association arlington va
     moreover the us market is on the verge of entering a new phase
with the advent of broadband personal communications services pcs 
it may be another year yet before pcs is marketed on a large scale
but pcs licensees are betting big bucks that both lower price points
and the digitally enhanced sound quality of calls placed over their
systems will prove appealing to consumers who have disdained cellular
as too costly and to at least some cellular subscribers    
     this years challenges for pcs players will be to finish the us
licensing processthe cblock spectrum auction see page 10 is set
to resume this weekand to bring newly licensed services to market
said tom mateer vice president of business development for sprint
telecommunications venture stv the alliance of sprint corp and
three large cable television operators
     our goal is to provide service in our own markets by the end of
1996 mateer said of kansas citybased stv the largest of the ab
block major trading area mta licensees in terms of potential market
population  other mta licensees including att wireless services and
pcs primeco lp are working against similar timetables
     while committed to code division multiple access cdma as its
technology
standard stv had not named equipment vendors for its network
buildoutestimated to cost from $3 billion to $4 billion by industry
sourcesat press time  mateer said talks with prospective suppliers
were moving along
     some funds from sprints longanticipated deal to sell 10 percent
equity interests to france telecom and germanys  deutsche telekom
which was approved by the fcc last month are expected to be earmarked
for stvs buildout
     on the narrowband side of pcs action will center on how
successfully competitors narrow the lead that mobile telecommunication
technologies corp mtel enjoys in this market  for its part mtel
continues to grapple with what alex brown  sons inc recently called
rollout concerns surrounding the companys skytel 2way advanced
messaging service  

  competition consolidation and convergence  more of the same
only more so

     perhaps the most important issue before the wireless industry is
how to compete effectively on a landscape that seemingly keeps
shifting beneath its feet  for many wireless players achieving
scale is the way to maximize their competitive ability  
     this consolidation trend has been most pronounced in paging
where arch communications group inc and airtouch paging announced the
most recent acquisitions deals giving them about 25 million and 22
million us subscribers respectively  suffice it to say that more
paging acqui sitions are in the offing this year
     but 1996 will see the introduction of new wireless players as
well via corporate spinoffs  for instance  sprints spinoff of its
sprint cellular subsidiary to shareholders wbf june 21 1995 is on
track for completion late next month or early in march and att
corps landmark breakup wbf sept 27 1995 is set to close by
years end
     other wireless companies may become publicly held entities 
pagemart inc the only privately held company among the top us
paging operators has hinted that it may go this route and london
financial circles are abuzz that hutchison wampoa of hong kong will
float orange its uk personal communications network pcnpossibly
as part of a larger realignment of its telecom interests
     and the cast of characters getting into wireless seems likely to
keep on growing  two recent examples 

       a unit of international family entertainment inc whose
chairman is evangelist pat robertson bought out the majority interest
held by motorola inc in pakistan mobile communications ltd licensed
to offer nationwide cellular service based on the global system for
mobile communications gsm standard as well as paging in the asian
country
       fidelity capital part of the bostonbased mutual funds giant
has helped engineer a deal aimed at strengthening specialized mobile
radio smr operator pittencrieff communications inc in its core
texas market wbf may 10 1995  pittencrieff shareholders were to
vote late this week on the companys merger with fidelityowned
advanced mobilecomm inc
     meanwhile convergence has continued to take on new and different
forms in wireless  for instance there is the growing trend among
competitionminded service providers to establish themselves as one
stop shops 
     in the space of a week last month dallasbased paging network
inc pagenet announced marketing agreements with both stv and gte
corp giving pagenet new distribution channels for its digital and
alphanumeric services in both the pcs and local telephone markets
respectively  
     stv by packaging cable services on a promotional basis with its
planned service offerings for the local and longdistance telephone
markets appears to be seeking as many distribution sources as
possible  stv also signed an agreement covering various text
messaging services with national dispatch center inc a san diego
based data network operator last month 

  technology  its show time for cdma iden

     technology like competition is a powerful catalyst for
convergence  the wireless industry should look during 1996 for more
developments along the lines of these recent announcements
       putting aside their intense rivalry motorola granted lm
ericsson ab a license to use flex motorolas highspeed paging
protocol in the swedish companys pagers and infrastructure
equipment
       ibm corp nokia and the pcs subsidiary of pacific telesis
group will work together on making wireless data services accessible
to subscribers via ibm thinkpad laptop computers  the ability to send
and receive email and facsimile messages and to gain access to the
internet will be a key selling point for pacific bell mobile services
in marketing pcs in its service area of california and nevada the
companies said
     but in the dynamic field of wireless technology the cdma air
interfaceand its promise of offering 10 times the capacity of analog
cellularno doubt will command the limelight right through 1996     
          the first cdma system to achieve commercial status was
hutchison telecoms cellular service in hong kong last fall  next up
will be a longawaited cellular network built out in los angeles by
airtouch communications which has spent much time finetuning it
followed by the
mid1996 launch of shinsegi telecommunications incs cellular system
in south korea wbf aug 30 1995
     importantly the 43 member companies of the cdma development
group have verified test results done with cdmas 13 kilobits per
second vocoder a touchstone to achieving wirelinequality voice
communications over cdma networks 
     cdma handsets for use on pcs networks are expected to become
available during the first half of 1996 said kevin kelley vice
president of external affairs for qualcomm inc san diego  the
company plans to ship 1 million terminals this year
     for enhanced specialized mobile radio esmr operator nextel
communications inc call at least some of the questions
surrounding the sound quality of motorolas esmr technology known as

imminent completion of its acquisition of dial page inc dpge the
rutherford njbased company plans to conduct asinglemarket beta
test of what nextel executives call reconfigured iden before the end
of march  based on the results the company will decide whether to
proceed with a more broadscale commercial introduction of the
technology nextel disclosed in a recent securities and exchange
commission filing
     meanwhile geotek communications incwith a $25 million line of
credit provided by hughes electronics corp at its disposal to acquire
additional 900 mhz spectrumwill begin commercial operation of its
own smr service in philadelphia its initial market this month
     finally two companies developing interferencereducing cellular
filters that use hightemperature superconducting materials are bound

telecommunications brazil and india wbf dec 6 1995 will merit
close scrutiny from the wireless industry this year as emerging

lack of handsets seen impeding dualband gsm services  

     cellular operators that employ global system for mobile
communications gsm technology in their networks should think long
and hard about pairing their services with gsms higherfrequency
counterparts dcs1800 and pcs1900
     so says toni stadelmann deputy managing director of mobile
services for swiss telecom which has deployed a dcs1800 personal
communications network pcn in geneva to go with its nationwide gsm
cellular network  
     while its experience with pcn has been limited
the geneva system was rolled out to coincide with the telecom 95
trade show and conference last octoberthe ptt plans to introduce
dcs1800 service in zurich and basel next fall as a capacityenhancing
supplement to 900 mhz cellular in these hightraffic markets
stadelmann told the pcs1900 in north america conference in washington
last month
     in the long run he said the company hopes to reach roaming
agreements that would tie its pcn service together with europes gsm
cellular operators and countries that either have pcn alreadythe
united kingdom germany and franceor are contemplating pcn rollouts
including sweden and italy
     but there is one sizable problem  wireless equipment
manufacturers need to speed up efforts to bring dualband mobile
phones to market  the subject of gsmdcs1800 handsets also came up
during another recent meeting in washington      i dont know of any
vendor today committed to developing these handsets malcolm cowan
general manager of the richardson texasbased pcs business unit of
northern telecom ltd told the pcs strategies conference 
     if recent contract announcements are any indication however
finlands nokia corp may be the first to take the plunge 
     the company has signed a twoyear contract with telia mobitel
the biggest gsm cellular network in sweden for the delivery of base
station subsystems that can be used either for a standalone dcs1800
network or a seamless dualband service  the base stations are
designed to bolster capacity in areas with heavy calling traffic as
well as to improve indoor coverage  

  savings on fixed and operating costs more flexibility in setting
rates

     nokias other recent gsmdcs1800 infrastructure deals were with
nordictel holdings of sweden and sonofon of denmark  it also was the
vendor for swiss telecoms dcs1800 system
     for swiss telecomscheduled to face competition in pcn beginning
in 1998 when spectrum set aside for private operators will be opened
uppairing gsm and dcs1800 will afford cost advantages in the areas
of infrastructure its transmission network and customer service and
billing stadelmann said  
     according to an analysis in which the ptt assigned different
weightings to these cost areas potential savings of 30 percent can be
had12 percent on both transmission network and billingcustomer
service expenses and another 6 percent on infrastructure costs
     moreover in limiting its pcn coverage to urban areas stadelmann
said that swiss telecom has found that it can devise a rate structure
that offers greater appeal to the more priceconscious segment of the
wireless voice market
     by setting rates close to those of the wireline network swiss
telecom hopes to induce customers to switch over to pcn from the fixed
network for the mobility it affords  but that of course first would
require a more robust roaming capability
     all stadelmann could do last month was ask rhetorically  what
are the manufacturers  doing  he would like to see action sooner
rather than later

glenayre nexus team up to support spreadspectrum technology

     glenayre technologies inc is considering plans to manufacture
receivers incorporating technology developed by nexus
telecommunication systems ltd which plans to market the technology
to paging operators aiming to address the low end of the twoway
messaging market
     the companies announced an agreement last month to collaborate on
integrating glenayremade switches controllers and base stations
with nexuss reversechannel receivers and twoway applications
platform  
     the deal is noteworthy because glenayre will provide protocol
information on the companys gl3000 advanced paging terminal that
would facilitate the operation of the twoway nexus network on
existing oneway paging systems  
     besides possibly making nexusbased receivers itself glenayre
holds an option to buy them from nexus as an original equipment
manufacturer  in return nexus granted the charlotte ncbased
company the right to obtain a worldwide license on its returnchannel
technology

  us beta test draws near 

     essentially the spreadspectrum nexus technology wbf nov 9
1994 affords oneway paging carriers a lowspeed return channel 
nexus network uses the unlicensed 902928 mhz band for the return
channel which operates at 200 bits per secondfar slower than reflex
or pact the narrowband personal communications service pcs
protocols developed by motorola inc and att wireless systems
respectively
     rani cohen senior vice president of givatayim israelbased
nexus said that nexus network is geared toward service offerings
where speed is not criticalmost notably a confirmation or short
messaging capability that would appeal to pricesensitive paging
subscribers
     a beta test of nexus network involving american paging inc and
several other us carriers is scheduled for next month  
minneapolisbased american paging holds five regional narrowband pcs
licenses 
     samsung the south korean conglomerate is expected to begin
shipping
twoway paging units supporting nexus network by next summer

multiple spectrum auctions and more on the way

     at the fccs dec 15 open meeting chairman reed hundt hailed the
prospect of simultaneous spectrum auctions as a tremendous
accomplishment  
     and with good reason  while the specialized mobile radio smr
auction that began a month ago generally has moved along at a more
sedate pace the cblock auction of bandwidth for broadband personal
communications services pcs kicked off with a bang on dec 18  net
high bids for the 493 cblock licenses exceeded $12 billion by the
end of the fourth round
     one hopeful puerto ricobased pcs 2000 lp offered an
astronomical $327 million in net high bids for basic trading area
bta licenses in the first round skewing the bidding  but the
hectic activity put to rest at least some doubts about whether the
longdelayed cblock auction would measure up to last years pcs
auction of major trading area licenses
     meanwhile smr operators praised fcc plans to auction widearea
licenses for 10 mhz in contiguous blocks of 20 60 and 120 channels in
the 800 mhz band  also two notices of proposed rulemaking nprms
will allot still more spectrum for use in wireless applications if
adopted as final rules by the fcc
       one would open the 37386 ghz band for pointtopoint
microwave operations  bta licenses would be auctioned offpossibly
as soon as a year from nowwith credits and installment plans
accorded to small businesses that wish to bid  a provision would
permit the processing of pending license applications in the 38640
ghz band 
       the other nprm would give hospitals access to vacant
television channels in the very and ultra highfrequency bands
doubling in many regions the number of frequencies available for
remote patient monitoring  higher power levels also would be allowed
for medical telemetry devices
