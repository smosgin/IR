from our dietitians

have you come across advertising that claims that the calcium
from plant foods is poorly absorbed spinach is typically held
up as an example while it is true that we only absorb about 5
of the calcium from spinach due to its high oxalate content
it is incorrect to assume that this automatically applies to all
vegetables in fact for lowoxalate vegetables such as broccoli
turnip kale brussels sprouts cauliflower and chinese greens
absorption is 5070 compared to approximately 32 for cow146s
milk 31 for tofu 21 for nuts and seeds and 17 for legumes
