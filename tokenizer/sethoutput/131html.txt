principalcomponent statistical studies

principalcomponent statistical studies


pcmdi has conducted exploratory studies of the potential usefulness of
various linear and nonlinear statistical methods for modelmodel and 
modeldata intercomparisons 

sengupta and boyle 1993 applied the technique of common principal 
components cpcs to identify similar modes among vertically averaged 
atmospheric temperature fields as observed by the microwave sounding 
unit msu on satellites as simulated by the ecmwf global atmospheric
model and as represented by ecmwf analyses a combination of data and 
model they concluded that the use of cpc is a potentially promising 
approach for rigorously identifying modeldata and modelmodel 
similarities especially when the analysis is restricted to regions 
eg the equatorial pacific where a dominant mode of variability 
eg the enso is likely to occur  

sengupta and boyle 1995 considered the relative merits of applying
nonlinear principal component analysis nlpca based on autoassociative 
neural networks vs the more traditional linear analysis pca to identify 
the dominant modes of precipitation variability over the us  they found 
that nlpca effected somewhat greater data reduction and that the leading 
nonlinear mode captured the seasonal cycle of precipitation more clearly 
than the leading linear mode  they concluded that use of nlpca should be 
considered especially when linear pca fails to uncover physically 
meaningful patterns in climatological data analysis
