abstract
resource allocation including manpower and other expenses have
limited the evolution of minimally invasive surgical procedures
to provide humanism and to improve surgical care for patients
robotic enhancement has been proposed as a mechanism to improve
the costbenefit relationship for patients to this end we have
used the robotic arm enhancement to minimize resource and personnel
utilization during minimally invasive procedures phase i of our
study has included the use of the robotic arm in 24 laparoscopic
hernia repairs cholecystectomies and nissen fundoplications
with the surgeon as a solosurgeon ie the primary surgeon
is the only participant in the operative sterile field the scrub
nurse did not participate in the procedures during this study
there were no technical mishaps no complications related to the
solosurgeon  robotic arm concept and the operative times were
statistically similar to equivalent procedures utilizing multiple
personnel the hernia repair is least complex and most amenable
to solosurgery due to the use of only three access ports cholecystectomy
occasionally requires four access ports increasing its complexity
to a measurable degree nissen fundoplication however requires
five access ports and proved to be the most complex of the procedures
to adapt successfully to solosurgery utilizing robotic arm enhancement

phase ii of our study has involved the
use of a combination of technologically complex and sophisticated
technology to improve outcomes in complex laparoscopic procedures
the headmounted display aesop the robotic arm and the harmonic
scalpel have been used in 140 complex minimally invasive procedures
the procedures were laparoscopic spine surgery 24 cases laparoscopic
gastric surgery 28 cases and laparoscopic colon resection 88
cases the use of these sophisticated technologies added safety
improved versatility and did not increase the length of the operative
procedures the use of multiple technologies had an additive effect
on the benefits there were no experiences in which the technologies
contributed to a technical complication or an adverse result for
the patients however the successful use of these technologies
requires an indepth educational experience for the surgeon and
for the operating room team

in a further effort to improve efficiency
and control of the visual fields during minimally invasive surgery
we have tested a new prototype voice activation and instrument
tracking control method for the robotic arm in order to create
a nearly seamless method to control the visual field prototype
voice activation and deactivation also allows instruments to be
used in the visual field for the surgical procedure while not
being used for tracking of the visual field tracking with the
instrument utilizing a colorcoded tracking system has been 100
effective in our hands has not induced errors in technical performance
of procedures and has shortened the time required for performance
of specific procedural tasks further this process improves versatility
for the surgeon increases concentration reduces fatigue and
does not interfere with the position of the surgeon areas for
improvement which have been observed utilizing these techniques
are 1 the use of appropriate and consistent voice activation
terminology and 2 the proper positioning of the instrument
tracking unit in the most appropriate locations on the video screen
and on the instrument within the visual field

we have concluded from these experiences
that the robotic technology will continue to reduce costs and
minimize risk for patients undergoing minimally invasive surgical
procedures moreover safety versatility and diminished use
of resources will accrue utilizing the additive benefit of sequential
sophisticated technologies requiring a simultaneous educational
investment in team development further we conclude that with
further development that voice activation and instrument tracking
of robotically enhanced minimally invasive surgical procedures
will improve efficiency effectiveness and will diminish risk
resource utilization and cost

introduction


surgical care of patients has heretofore enjoyed
improved quality of care and diminished risk to patients due to
continuous technological advancements and similar improvements
for the operating room environment improvement associated with
sophisticated technology has however historically been associated
with an increase in resource utilization most often measured
by increased cost the current medical economic environment
however tends to slow the progress elucidated by technology due
to the intense focus on minimizing cost and resource utilization
in the healthcare environment as a result new and evolving technology
carries a new burden not only must the technology improve the
efficiency and productivity of the surgeon and simultaneously
decrease risk to the patient but it must also reduce cost andor
resource utilization in order to be considered a viable product
for the current surgical operating theater

in an attempt to address this issue we have chosen
to use robotic arm enhancement as the key technology to reduce
cost in the operating theater while simultaneously diminishing
patient risk and improving productivity and quality of patient
care the robotic arm is most often used in minimally invasive
surgery to hold the laparoscope and camera it moves the visual
surgical field with precision under the direct control of the
surgeon1 thus one personnel resource a physicians
assistant or assistant surgeon is no longer required for the
operative procedure allowing the individual to provide health
care for other patients further control of the visual field
by the surgeon diminishes the need for communication between personnel
and improves the focus and concentration of the surgeon moreover
the robotic arm maintains the optical field stable and motionless
providing the surgeon with an environment for improved precision
and efficiency during the surgical tasks a further benefit
of the stable motionless image occurs in conjunction with the
use of the robotic arm and 3d technology for minimally invasive
procedures the motionless image improves the quality of the 3d
image dramatically when compared to the handheld 3d image thus
the cumulative benefit of two technologies enhances the visual
field with resultant improved quality and efficiency by the surgeon
as well as a concomitant diminution in the risk of error during
the procedural tasks other sophisticated technologies which synergistically
improve efficiency and thereby diminish risk as well as shorten
operating time with a commensurate decrease in costs or operating
room utilization include the headmounted display hmd the
harmonic scalpel and the zoom camera lens

the hmd provides the surgeon with a relaxed position
and binocular vision thus further improving the stability of the
visual surgical image2 the hmd specifically allows
the surgeon to always work in a normal handeye axis thus avoiding
inefficient and dangerous paradoxic motion3 it also
enhances the benefits of 3d technology with the addition of binocular
vision4 providing a circumstance to further improve
efficiency and decrease risk thus improving outcome

the harmonic scalpel is a versatile laparoscopic
instrument which cuts coagulates acts as a retractor grasper
pointer sharp dissector and blunt dissector5 its
use diminishes instrument exchanges and thereby increases the
focus of the surgeon diminishes the need for intermittently changing
operative visual fields for instrument exchange with resultant
cumulative benefits in the areas of efficiency operative time
patient risk and ultimate resource utilization

the zoom camera lens adds the opportunity for the
surgical operative field to be a fisheye panoramic view versus
a very close detailed view being under the direct control of the
surgeon and changeable by the turn of a switch this added versatility
in the size of the visual field adds a magnitude of versatility
to the use of the robotic arm

the robotic arm technology currently is controlled
by the surgeon with a foot pedal while the foot pedal provides
reasonable control by the surgeon other foot pedals compete for
space and attention in the operating theater other forms of control
and activation of the robotic arm and subsequent control of the
visual field would seem to be beneficial

to address these issues we have designed a threepart
study the first is the performance of solosurgeon procedures
solosurgery using robotic enhancement6 as the aid
the second is the cumulative and synergistic benefits of multiple
sophisticated technologies along with the robotic arm to enhance
efficiency in complex minimally invasive procedures and the third
phase is to investigate the use of prototype instrument tracking
and voice activation to control the robotic arm and subsequently
control the visual laparoscopic field of view


methods


phase i we performed solosurgeon surgery for 24
patients who were electively undergoing either laparoscopic hernia
repair laparoscopic cholecystectomy or laparoscopic nissen fundoplication
in all cases solosurgery was defined as quotperformance of
the operative procedure without the help of an assistant a nurse
or another surgeonquot the scrub nurse did not help the surgeon
during the procedure in all cases the time of the operative
procedure operative technical mishaps and the number of occasions
that the laparoscope was removed from the abdomen to clean the
tip were recorded the laparoscope was affixed to the robotic
arm in all cases and control of the robotic arm the laparoscope
and the subsequent optical surgical field of view were controlled
by the surgeon using a foot pedal control these data were compared
to similar data collected from patients undergoing these three
minimally invasive procedures in circumstances in which robotic
arm enhancement was not used and the surgery was not performed
by solosurgeon

during each of the laparoscopic solosurgeon procedures
a second surgeon or a physicians assistant was immediately available
to help the solosurgeon in circumstances of necessity

phase ii to assess the cumulative benefits of the
robotic arm plus other sophisticated technologies in improving
efficiency during highly complex minimally invasive surgical procedures
we utilized robotic arm enhancement plus a combination of hmd
3d optics the fisheye zoom lens the harmonic scalpel and
the ergonomic sitting position during 140 elective procedures
the procedural experiences were laparoscopic anterior spine surgery
24 cases laparoscopic gastric surgery 28 cases and laparoscopic
colon resection 88 cases the number of operative technical
mishaps the category of the first assistant surgeon vs physicians
assistant and the number of times the scope was removed to clean
the tip were recorded these data were compared to comparable
data recorded for patients undergoing these procedures in the
absence of sophisticated technologies

phase iii the porcine model was used to study instrument
tracking and voice activation of the robotic arm in order to move
the operative field of view by the surgeon for instrument tracking
computer activation of a color sensor by a blue tape on the shaft
of the surgeons instrument in the operative field was used once
the field of view was moved to a new location by the device tracking
the blue shaft on the surgeons instrument the tracking was deactivated
complex laparoscopic skills were performed including running the
bowel suturing tying and dissecting adhesions using the instrument
tracking device the ability or inability to move the visual field
appropriately during the performance of complex skills was recorded
to determine the ability of voice activation to control the operative
field of view using the robotic arm the surgeon imprinted the
following words on the voice activation device quotinquot
quotoutquot quotleftquot quotrightquot quotupquot
quotdownquot quotstopquot the use of each command activated
the robotic arm to move the visual field in the direction described
by the command the command quotstopquot deactivated the
robot resulting in a stable motionless field of view complex
laparoscopic tasks were again used during activation and deactivation
using voice commands


results


solosurgery the 24 patients who underwent solosurgery
using robotic arm enhancement and minimally invasive approach
all experienced successful completion of their operative procedures
there were no incidents of technical mishap in any of the procedures
the cholecystectomy procedures had an average operating time of
54 minutes compared to 61 minutes for other laparoscopic cholecystectomy
patients the solosurgery laparoscopic herniorrhaphy procedures
had an operative time of 76 minutes compared to 84 minutes for
nonsolo surgeon laparoscopic herniorrhaphy procedures the solosurgery
laparoscopic nissen fundoplication procedures had an average operating
time of 112 minutes compared to an operating time of 160 minutes
for comparable nonsolo surgery operative procedures the number
of times the laparoscope required cleaning per 60minute interval
for cases involving solosurgery and the robotic arm were 14
compared to 91 per 60minute interval for comparable cases when
the robotic arm was not used

complex laparoscopic procedures using cumulative
sophisticated technologies of the 140 patients undergoing complex
minimally invasive surgery utilizing a combination of robotic
arm enhancement the harmonic scalpel the headmounted display
3d technology and the ergonomic sitting position all were successfully
completed utilizing the minimally invasive approach there were
no technical mishaps either related or unrelated to the technologies
operating times were 155 minutes for gastric procedures 153 minutes
for colectomy procedures and 125 minutes for anterior spine procedures
each being comparable to operative times for comparable procedures
when not using the additive benefits of these technologies the
average number of times the laparoscope was removed to clean its
tip per 60minute interval during these procedures was 10 compared
to 77 per 60minute interval for comparable procedures when not
using the robotic arm technology

instrument tracking and voice activation the use
of the instrument tracking mechanism to move the visual operative
field by a colorcoded instrument shaft was entirely successful
utilizing motions to the left to the right in an upward direction
or a downward direction however the ability of the instrument
tracking mechanism to move the field inward and outward was less
successful further the use of complex skills with instrumentation
all were successfully accomplished when the tracking was inactivated
however if the surgeon required movement of the visual field
during the performance of a complex skill utilizing this instrumentation
then instrument tracking was unable to accomplish movement of
the visual field

voice activation of the robotic arm to accomplish
movement of the visual operative field of view was entirely successful
motions to the right and left up and down as well as in and
out were all successfully accomplished with ease however two
voice commands were always necessary the command to start the
motion of the robotic arm and the command to quotstopquot
further the use of voice activation as a mechanism to move the
visual field in small increments when necessary  especially during
performance of laparoscopic complex skills provided a solution
to movement of the visual field during the performance of skills
with the surgeons instruments


discussion


the use of the robotic arm to enhance minimally invasive
operative procedures is identified and delineated in these studies
in a variety of ways use of robotics to enhance the opportunity
for a surgeon to perform solosurgery without increasing the length
of the operative procedures is delineated in phase i of our study
using laparoscopic cholecystectomy laparoscopic hernia repair
and laparoscopic nissen fundoplication further there were no
technical mishaps and no technical complications either related
or unrelated this data diminishes cost and resource utilization
by allowing either a surgeonfirst assistant or a physicians
assistant to not be utilized thus allowing these medical personnel
to be free to perform other healthcare interventions for other
patients it should be noted that no additional equipment was
required to perform solosurgery thus the resource quottradeoffquot
is the robotic arm in exchange for versatile medical personnel

in circumstances in which laparoscopic nissen fundoplication
and cholecystectomy were performed utilizing the solosurgeon
methodology the procedures usually involve four ports cholecystectomy
or five ports nissen fundoplication in these circumstances
there are often three personnel participating in the operative
procedure these include the surgeon the first assistant and
the camera holder as a result these latter two procedures may
actually be modified by the solosurgeon concept in order to exchange
two medical personnel for a modified preoperative setup and robotic
arm enhancement

the solosurgeon experiences have raised two important
issues to the surgeons consciousness the first is that the use
of the robotic arm diminishes the number of occasions per 60minute
interval that the laparoscope must be removed and cleaned at the
tip since each occasion of removal and defogging uses time and
also defocuses the surgeon then the reduction in these cleaning
maneuvers should result in a shortening of the operative time
as well as diminishing risk due to defocusing of the surgeons
attention during a procedure further since the robotic arm holds
the position of the scope and the surgeons optical field of view
motionless and perfectly stationary it allows for a much more
stable and concentrated field of view for the surgeon to work
this phenomenon would seem to eventually translate into shortened
operating time increased concentration decreased fatigue and
a diminution in risk of operative error

the use of the robotic arm to enhance the efficiency
and safety of complex minimally invasive procedures along with
the synergistic benefits of other sophisticated technologies clearly
is practical and imminently possible in our series the addition
of multiple complex technologies did not lengthen the operative
procedures and did not result in technical mishaps further the
reduction of medical personnel from three individuals to two personnel
invariably occurred diminishing cost and human resource utilization
the robotic arm itself maintained a stable and motionless operative
field for the surgeon throughout the cases and minimized the number
of scope cleaning events both of these factors increased the
concentration and focus of the surgeon providing continuity to
the procedure without interruption the use of the hmd in all
circumstances allowed the surgeon to maintain a normal handeye
axis allowing the work to be in front of the surgeon with hisher
visual field exactly in the same plane as the laparoscopic procedure
being performed this benefit diminished fatigue accommodated
a nonparadoxical approach to the procedural tasks and eliminated
the risks and inefficiencies associated with paradoxical motion
either related to a disparity in the location of the visual monitor
or a disparity in the location of the relationship between the
surgeon and his work7

a further benefit perceived by the surgeon when using
the hmd is the binocular vision which occurs because of the dual
liquid crystal displays in the hmd the leftsided display provides
a visual field for the left eye and the rightsided display provides
a visual field for the right eye this binocular vision gives
the surgeon a perception of depth and allows the eyes to fix on
a very distant focal point to reduce eye fatigue when coupled
with 3d technology the hmd brings the surgeon binocular vision
and depth as a result a quotnormalquot threedimensional
field is perceived as opposed to an quotexaggeratedquot threedimensional
field as perceived when the active 3d glasses are used along
with the 3d active monitor it might also be noted that the cost
of the hmd in exchange for the active 3d glasses and the 3d
monitor provides a major savings as well as technical safety and
efficiency

threedimensional technology itself adds depth to
the visual operative field diminishing the risk of technical error
inherent when working in a twodimensional field further the
surgeon is not required to spend time and excess motions developing
tactile clues to accommodate for the lack of depth in the twodimensional
field this phenomenon can be translated into shorter operating
times

the harmonic scalpel lcs adds a subsequent degree
of increased efficiency and diminished risk to the aforementioned
technologies during complex minimally invasive surgical procedures
the lcs is a highly versatile instrument which cuts coagulates
retracts grasps and bluntly dissects8 therefore
its versatility diminishes cost in three separate ways it eliminates
the need for a variety of other instruments it diminishes the
number of instrument exchanges performed during a complex procedure
and it uses ultrasonic energy to cut and coagulate rather than
using monopolar cautery the use of the lcs eliminates the need
for endoscopic scissors endoscopic multiple clip applier monopolar
cautery cautery line and grounding pad elimination of these
items reduced direct costs the reduction in instrument exchanges
maintains the surgeons focus on the procedure and diminishes
the waste of time and loss of concentration which occurs to the
operating team during instrument exchanges lastly the elimination
of the risk of monopolar cautery when using the lcs may be translated
to decreased cost due to decreased risk

the use of a foot pedal to control the robotic arm
and the subsequent operative field of view laparoscopically in
complex minimally invasive surgical procedures presents a rather
unique experience at one extreme many complex procedures subtotal
colectomies gastric resections trauma cases require movement
of the surgeon from one portion of the torso to another the necessity
of surgeon mobility detracts from the effectiveness and efficiency
of the robotic foot pedal on the other hand many long complex
minimally invasive procedures are benefited from placing the surgeon
in the ergonomically beneficial sitting position which diminishes
the effective use of the foot pedal further most surgeons have
other foot pedals as part of their procedure including either
the harmonic scalpel foot pedal or the cautery foot pedal the
potential for increased complexity involving the robotic foot
pedal tends to diminish efficiency and effectiveness therefore
we have attempted to utilize computerized instrument tracking
and voice activation as alternative methods to direct the surgical
field of view by way of the robotic arm these experiences have
delineated that the use of a blue color activated tracking system
on the shaft of an instrument accomplishes efficient movement
of the field of view to left and right as well as up and down
however a number of movements are not successfully accomplished
by instrument tracking first the quotinquot and quotoutquot
positions require a command other than instrument tracking secondly
an additional command is required to deactivate instrument tracking
in order for the surgeon to utilize his instrument for a technical
task while simultaneously holding the field of view steady in
addition once the instrument tracking system has been deactivated
and the surgeon is using his instruments for a technical task
the requirement for a small or moderate alteration in the visual
field to accommodate the surgeon cannot be accomplished by instrument
tracking because the instruments are being used for the surgical
task therefore an additional command is necessary in this latter
circumstance the addition of a prototype voice activation system
allows the surgeon to move the field of view inward and outward
it also provides the opportunity to deactivate and reactivate
the instrument tracking system finally the voice activation
and voice command may be used to accomplish fine movements while
performing a delicate surgical task with the instruments we believe
this combination of control devices will further improve efficiency
and versatility of the robotic arm to enhance minimally invasive
surgical procedures

these data delineate that each of the technologies
described improve safety diminish resource utilization improve
efficiency and versatility for the surgeon and are clearly usable
synergistically together to maximize the benefits for the patient
the authors strongly believe that further investigations to study
the details of each of these technologies and their respective
benefits are urgent and necessary
