summer salads
what can be more appetizing on a hot summer146s day than a
plateful of crisp colourful vegetables  salads offer a great
way of incorporating essential omega 3 fatty acids by using coldpressed
oils such as flax canola soybean or walnut in dressings when
used as  main dishes they can also include a light source of
protein such as sprouted beans or nuts and seeds
selecting vegetable oils for salads


extra virgin olive oil the fullbodied first press without chemicals
or heat is the best all  other types are poorer quality and can
be lighter in flavour contains natural beta sistosterol vitamin
e and other antioxidants does not need refrigeration found
in supermarkets or natural food stores

flax oil a great source of essential omega 3 fatty acids for
vegans or others who don146t eat fish available in natural
food stores the best and richest form is cold pressed the container
should be dark to minimize light peroxidation look for the expiry
date and always refrigerate or freeze for longer periods coldpressed
oils should not be heated excessively and are best used with
salads and on cooked vegetables or grains  the wonderful flax
oil dressing included here goes particularly well with green salads

earthsave news amp views

the dairy industry has bought a large soy milk company151
pacific soy151which is currently producing soy milk for other
soy industries they have asked the canadian government to allow
this soy milk to be fortified with b12 zinc calcium and
vitamin d with this industry  supporting such a request we are
likely to see fortified products on the market by the autumn
this manoeuvre will provide more opportunity for vegans or those
who choose not to use cow146s milk to conveniently obtain
adequate amounts of these nutrients
