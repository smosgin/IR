abolition 2000

a global network to eliminate nuclear weapons

the abolition 2000 network is a network of over 300 organisations and
growing on every continent working for the abolition of nuclear weapons
it grew from many seeds  the world court project the international
coalition for nonproliferation the global alliance against nuclear arms=

the abolition caucus etc all of these movements are like streams that l=
ed
into the river that is the abolition 2000 network it is not a membership
body but is open to all organisations endorsing the abolition statement
drafted at the npt conference in new york in 1995 its overarching
premise is the vision of entering the 21st century with a plan in place f=
or
the elimination of nuclear weapons

what is the network
300 organisations have organised themselves into what was termed a
tight rather than the usual loose network which aims to provide group=
s
concerned with nuclear issues a forum for the exchange of information
and the development of joint initiatives the tightness of the network
like the tautness of a web is defined by how close the members of the
network work together and how good the lines of communication are

the network plans to have an office in california usa staffed by a
facilitator the global network office will be overseen by a management
group the substantive work of the network is done by international
working groups on issues relating to the abolition of nuclear weapons

how did it come about
in 1995 at the conference to review and extend the nonproliferation
treaty in new york a group of 40 to 50 activists representing ngos from
all around the world met each day to coordinate their work and called
themselves the abolition caucus this group drafted a consensus
document which was known as the abolition statement in less than two
weeks the first 200 organisations had signed the statement and this
number is still growing added to this the international coalition for
nonproliferation organised a meeting during the npt conference on a
draft nuclear weapons convention called beyond the npt the
demand for a convention became the prime focus of the lobbying work of
the abolition caucus and also of the abolition statement they called on
the delegates to

initiate immediately and conclude by the year
2000 negotiations on a nuclear weapons abolition
convention that requires the phased elimination
of all nuclear weapons within a timebound
framework with provisions for effective
verification and enforcement

the abolition caucus requested the npt parties to adopt this goal in the
final report of the conference the opposition to the indefinite
unconditional  extension of the npt was clearly expressed in the original
statement which has since been updated to remove references to the
conference and other dates

development of the network
a core group went on to organise a further meeting in the hague to
coincide with the oral hearings at the international court of justice in
november 1995 of the advisory opinion on the use and threat of use of
nuclear weapons world court project the 60 participants at this
meeting agreed by consensus to found a network and defined its
structure the title abolition 2000  a global network to eliminate
nuclear weapons was chosen

the idea of a tight network consisting of regions working groups and =
a
distributioncommunications centre later titled the global network
office was born most importantly it was decided that there should be
no central committee to take decisions on behalf of the network and that
initially no common strategy would be decided except to take action
under the only agreed common position the abolition statement which
everybody had signed the group that had organised the meeting in the
hague was given the task of setting up the office and finding the funding
for a staff person for it a second meeting in edinburgh in march 1996
gave this group the title interim management group whose function is
solely to oversee the functioning of the global network office the
members of the interim management group are  lysiane alizard

the working groups
the working groups deal with substantive issues arising out of the
abolition statement they concentrate on furthering the 11 points
included in the statement and recommend further strategies to the
network the members of each working group are fluid but the convenor
remains the same some groups meet regularly and others communicate
by email fax telephone and post anyone interested can participate at
any one time by contacting the convenor

the time is right to demand a nuclear weapons convention nwc as in
the abolition statement negotiations should start now because it will be=
 a
long process to complete them and ngos should be involved in this
working for a nwc is the logical next step of the world court project as
it is for the international network of engineers and scientists and the
pugwash who have set up a study group on the nwc at the groups
meeting in new york in march 1996 an outline of the elements of a model
treaty was discussed with various participants taking on the drafting of
specific language an executive summary of the treaty is now complete
and has been forwarded to the canberra commission a commission of
experts convened by the australian government to discuss concrete
measures to achieve the abolition of nuclear weapons plans are being
made to organise a world conference to abolish nuclear weapons in
1998

the work of this group refers to the points on testing in the abolition
statement working for a truly comprehensive test ban that prevents
development of nuclear weapons and for the closure of the test sites the
ctbt negotiations are now underway in geneva the test ban will most
likely not be comprehensive because the nuclear weapons states have
developed the technical capability to replace testing computer simulated
tests are far from messing around on a laptop  the facilities are as big=
 or
bigger than football stadiums above ground explosions take place that
are not technically termed nuclear explosions although explosions take
place using nuclear material there are also plans for laser fusion
facilities at lawrence livermore laboratory in california usa and in
bordeaux france megajoule technical knowledge and understanding of
what subcritical hydrodynamic or hydronuclear tests are or what laser o=
r
intertial confinement fusion is will be an important task of this group
these are the methods of the future that will enable the nuclear weapons
states to continue collecting data and experimenting with the
modernisation miniaturisation and design of nuclear weapons the group
is campaigning to get language introduced into the preamble of the ctbt
language available from jackie cabasso that will specifically refer to =
the
prevention of the development of nuclear weapons as the intention of the
treaty the concept of the test ban and beyond is to favour an early
conclusion of the ctbt while recognising that this will not fulfil our

fissile materials no convenor as yet
much work is going on in this area by organisations in the network
although a working group has not yet formally been convened the
conference on disarmament in geneva plans to negotiate a fissile material
cutoff after completion of the ctbt discussions at present are around
the issues of banning fissile material completely  ie destroying stock=
piles
 and the production of fissile materials in the civilian sector if the
stockpiles remain the present status quo will be perpetuated as with th=

npt and most likely with the ctbt that the declared nuclear weapons
states retain their capability while forbidding it for all others this =
is not
disarmament disallowing fissile material production only in the military
and not in the civilian sector repeats the mistake of the npt by ignoring
that nuclear energy produces bomb material that can be diverted legally
or illegally for military purposes the question of fissile material
production is important because it cuts off the source of material  pul=

alliances in the future for solving security problems the weu is accepte=
d
as the european leg of nato an opportunity to open the discussion on
common security policy in europe is emerging preceding maastricht ii
ngos should try to intervene in this discussion the group proposes that
the osce is the correct organ to work on security in europe through
solving conflicts nonviolently and on a political level the osce is muc=
h
bigger than weu or nato with 54 member states including states from
eastern europe neutral states and all nato members security is not a
military problem but often to do with ethnic religious or economic
problems rather than a threat of outside invasion the osce is currently
under swiss presidency it is launching a discussion on a model for
security in the 21st century and is inviting input the group suggests
encouraging nonnuclear weapons states to participate in this discussion
if the weu is accepted as europes security force then the currently
proposed security arrangement  a european nuclear deterrent shared by
france uk germany belgium holland spain greece turkey and
others  will become a reality

professionals have the ability to influence decisionmakers in their area=
s of
competence during lobbying work on the ctbt and npt it has become
clear that many organisations are involved in lobbying and this work
often crosses over this working group would focus on methodology it
would help set up international delegations and avoid duplication of
efforts it could discuss best approaches to different negotiating forums
ippnw has also been working with oxford research group on
dialoguing with decisionmakers such as nuclear scientists arms traders=

military leaders ippnw  has met with nato to discuss a nuclear weapon
free zone in eastern europe already had some success in bringing
military leaders from britain and china together to discuss security and
abolition the lobbying and dialoguing needs corresponding campaigning
to show the breadth of support behind it and to involve the grassroots
with this work in postcard letterwriting and fax actions working with
political parties locally and nationally as well as local authorities i=
s very
important the idea of nuclear free zones is useful in this context
