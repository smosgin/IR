srl2  weddell sea antarctica
weddell sea antarctica 
 
this spaceborne imaging radarcxband synthetic aperture radar 
color composite shows a portion of the weddell sea which is 
adjacent to the continent of antarctica the image shows  
extensive coverage of firstyear sea ice mixtures and patches of 
open water inside the ice margin the image covers a 100 
kilometer by 30 kilometer 62 mile by 185 mile region of the 
southern ocean centered at approximately 57 degrees south 
latitude and 3 degrees east longitude which was acquired on 
october 3 1994  data used to create this image were obtained 
using the lband horizontally transmitted and vertically 
received in red the lband horizontally transmitted and 
received in green and the cband horizontally transmitted and 
received in blue the sea ice which appears rustbrown in the 
image is composed of loosely packed floes from approximately 1 
meter to 2 meters 3 feet to 65 feet thick and ranging from 1 
meter to 20 meters 3 feet to 655 feet in diameter large 
patches of open water shown as turquoise blue are scattered 
throughout the area which is typical for ice margins 
experiencing office winds  the thin wellorganized lines 
clearly visible in the ice pack are caused by radar energy 
reflected by floes riding the crest of ocean swells  the wispy 
black features seen throughout the image represent areas where 
new ice is forming sea ice because it acts as an insulator 
reduces the loss of heat between the relatively warm ocean and 
cold atmosphere  this interaction is an important component of 
the global climate system   because of the unique combination 
of winds currents and temperatures found in this region ice 
can extend many hundreds of kilometers north of antarctica each 
winter which classifies the weddell sea as one of natures 
greatest icemaking engines  during the formation of sea ice 
great quantities of salt are expelled from the frozen water  
the salt increases the density of the upper layer of sea water 
which then sinks to great depths  oceanographers believe this 
process forms most of the oceans deep water  sea ice covering 
all of the southern oceans including the weddell sea typically 
reaches its most northerly extent in about september as periods 
of daylight become gradually longer in the southern hemisphere 
ice formation stops and the ice edge retreats southward  by 
february most of the sea ice surrounding antarctica disappears 
imaging radar is extremely useful for studying the polar regions 
because of the long periods of darkness and extensive cloud 
cover  the multiple frequencies of the sircxsar instruments 
allow further study into ways of improving the separation of the 
various thickness ranges of sea ice which are vital to 
understanding the heat balance in the ice ocean and atmospheric 
system
