srl1  raco biomass map
raco biomass map

this biomass map of the raco michigan area was produced from
data acquired by the spaceborne imaging radar cxband synthetic
aperture radar sircxsar onboard space shuttle endeavour 
biomass is the amount of plant material on an area of earths
surface  radar can directly sense the quantity and
organizational structure of the woody biomass in the forest 
science team members at the university of michigan used the radar
data to estimate the standing biomass for this raco site in the
upper peninsula of michigan  detailed surveys of 70 forest
stands will be used to assess the accuracy of these techniques 
the seasonal growth of terrestrial plants and forests in
particular leads to the temporary storage of large amounts of
carbon which could directly affect changes in global climate  
in order to accurately predict future global change scientists
need detailed information about current distribution of
vegetation types and the amount of biomass present around the
globe  optical techniques to determine net biomass are
frustrated by chronic cloudcover  imaging radar can penetrate
through cloudcover with negligible signal losses
