facility will treat at least 99 percent of approximately 65000 cubic 
meters of transuranic and alpha wastes currently stored at inel and have 
additional flexibility and capacity to treat an additional 20000 cubic 
meters of optional waste
     the facilitys integrated treatment process will achieve an overall 
waste volume reduction of more than 65 percent and will result in waste 
forms that can be accepted either by the waste isolation pilot plant 
wipp or a low level waste storagedisposal facility  to treat the 
plutoniumcontaminated mixed waste at the inel the bnfl team will employ 
proven technologies from its sellafield site in the united kingdom
