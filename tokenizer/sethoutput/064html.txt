student report seven


	this is it folks endeavor lands tomorrow and were going home either tomorrow or 
wednesday what a long strange trip its been 

	yknow weve been writing these things for a week and a half now and i wonder if 
anyone has been reading them im going to post our email addresses at the end of this 
so that if you get the urge  to say hi to ask further questions or just to tell us that you 
read these things  you can 

	yesterday was aarons airground link with endeavor and well let him speak up later 
first yesterdays report talked a lot about the outside of jsc which is interesting but kind 
of superfluous the really incredible stuff is whats in the buildings

	you already know about the clean rooms mission control and eol the only other 
place that weve got personal experience with is building eight half of building eight is 
the onsite medical facility the other half the half weve used has video and photo labs 
and a computer set up to print photos from laser disk 

	ive got to diverge from my divergence for a bit to tell you about the photos an 
average shuttle mission comes home with three to five thousand frames of photographic 
film from cameras high enough quality that they can take detailed earth pictures from 
orbit these pictures are all developed numbered cataloged according to latitude  
longitude main visible features etc this information is stored in a database at jsc called 
sseopjscnasagov which is public access nasa also publishes laser disks which 
contain several tens of thousands of shuttle photos apiece which makes it slightly easier to 
find lets say the photos from sts42 roll 97 frame 143

	thats the only other building that we know from personal experience however 
weve been told about a lot of incredible stuff which hopefully well get to see once the 
shuttle has landed theres a building which is set up to run simulations in mission 
control it has the capabilities to feed data into mission control that exactly replicates a 
shuttle mission and they can go through any number of anomalies to see how well the 
ground crew is prepared for them unless you have participated in a simulation youre not 
allowed through mission control unescorted during a mission

	astronaut training goes on here and i assume theyve also got the standard battery of 
equipment that youve seen in the right stuff however im told that they have a full 
array of vr equipment the american government is just about the biggest user of vr in 
the world for just such applications like this the equipment they use today probably saves 
them thousands of dollars per astronaut in materials used for training 

	a slight divergence and then well go to aaron if anyone out there in netland is 
interested in working on a shuttle mission this is for you sts 68 the second srl 
mission is flying in august by then we would like to have a network of people across 
the country or even across the world if possible online to jsc during the mission if 
any of these people knew of anything interesting going on in their area flooding fires 
anything major that could be seen from space and might make a difference to the radar 
theyd write in to us with a report of what they knew where they were any and all 
information that they thought pertinent our information here is limited by what gets put on 
the net or in the newspapers if its something like a volcano eruption or an earthquake 
were not likely to get any information until its over and while aftermath is probably 
interesting it doesnt give us any more information about the way the world works so if 
youre interested in helping out a shuttle mission write to either aaron or jon

	and now to wrap up the series heres aaron with what happened last night


	stop the presses before aaron says a word weve forgotten to thank the six 
most important people in the entire mission


	thank you shuttle commander sidney gutierrez

	thank you mission specialist michael clifford

	thank you pilot kevin chilton

	thank you mission specialist thomas jones

	thank you payload commander linda godwin

	thank you mission specialist jay apt


	these six are the astronauts who served aboard the endeavour weve been leaving out 
the u in endeavour all week oops for sts59 the space radar laboratory it was their 
incredible dedication and hard work that enabled this mission to go so spectacularly 
smoothly and we almost forgot to thank them shame on us now back to our regularly 
scheduled report


	here we go to start out i was talking to linda godwin the payload commander it 
was kind of neat because i also talked to her once before last summer at jpl no particular 
amenities were exchanged the format of our conversations with the crew are a long 
comment then several smaller comments with space for response i told her about how i 
worked two years ago in the field on the upper peninsula of michigan on one of the sites 
that they have imaged i told her about what an incredible experience it was getting away 
from a science class to do something like that or like working at jsc the feeling is 
absolutely different learning on the job like this is incredible what im doing matters 
and that makes all the difference in the world if something goes wrong in a high school 
physics class nobody cares here when someone asks you to find something out and they 
need it in an hour for the shuttle flyby you dont get a chance to do it over and you do 
not fail if you did screw up i dont really think that anyone would care they plan for 
that and it happens but thats not what happens you do it you do the best job possible 
and if it involves learning some radar science or meteorology or computer science well 
thems the breaks

	i love it

	anyway once i got done with that i noted that i had been wondering how different the 
training had been for this mission as opposed to her others and she was nice enough to 
oblige me by telling me pretty much the same thing happened when i wondered what 
differences she noticed in the state of the world between yesterday and a week before that 
all in all it was fun and informative and i got a real kick out of talking to the shuttle


	ok folks heres where we get off its been fun  we all learned a little and nobody 
got hurt i hope that youve enjoyed reading these things as much as weve enjoyed writing 
them we encourage correspondence  thats how you learn and learnings how you 
grow 


	signing off
