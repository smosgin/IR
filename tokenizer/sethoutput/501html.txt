marimba a closely watched startup company today took the wraps off a new suite of javabased technology that lets web sites broadcast information and software over the internet

marimbas first products collectively called castanet will include client and server software along with a development kit for distributing information across a network to clients ranging from graphics to spreadsheets the company has applied for a patent on its core technology 

the company also said today that several leading web sites including those run by online magazine hotwired and search engine excite are already offering content through channels using castanet

while traditional web pages require a user to seek out a site to view information and run applets the marimba system will use a tvstyle metaphor for delivering content or applications to usersbroadcasting or pushing information and programs out to desktops 

this is a method of distributing information that was pioneered by pointcast and is receiving more attention from internet companies such as microsoft and netscape communications earlier this year pointcast debuted a specialized client applicationpart web browser part screensaverthat automatically receives news headlines financial information and advertisements over the net

the two leading browser companies microsoft and netscape have also made clear their intentions to offer net broadcasting capabilities in the next releases of their products for example microsofts internet explorer 40 will feature active themes or onscreen widgets that display news and other information on the windows 95 desktop like a tv channel 

in the pullmodel the onus is always on the user to go back said ira machevsky a senior industry analyst at giga information group these are devices to throw the electronic newspaper to your doorstep 

but while most companies are focused primarily on broadcasting content castanet is expected to allow the distribution of java applications such as a frontend to a database which can be regularly updated by a network administrator analysts and developers hope that castanet will appeal to companies that want to ease the task of constantly updating applications

at the corporate level it will help the mis director who has to update 1000 or 2000 copies of an application said karl jacob ceo of dimension x users wont even notice it

marimba also claims that castanet can update news stories so quickly that it is near real time requires little network bandwidth and can scale to millions of users the improved performance of programs and content is due chiefly to the fact that castanet allows java code to persistthat is to be stored locally on a hard diskrather than disappearing when a pc is shut down

thats one of the big holes in java and network computers the lack of persistence said david smith research director at gartner group this really does use local storage intelligently in realworld applications download times are important

the marimba system will feature a clientside tuner program for receiving data and a backend transmitter program for broadcasting the data both of which will be written in java the software applications and data channels themselves are stored on the users hard drive instead of being downloaded over the internet each time the user looks for new information 

marimba also unveiled a drag and drop development toolkit called bongo for assembling broadcast data next week initially castanet will be limited to distributing java applications for security reasons the system will later allow for distribution of a variety of applications including activex controls version 11 due in the first half of 1997 will include encryption support and support for application deployment over public networks 

marimbas first product announcement has been eagerly anticipated by silicon valley headed up by kim polese a former sun microsystems manager the company is among the first to focus exclusively on developing java applications in addition to polese the company is staffed by several former java engineers from sun including jonathan payne arthur van hoff and sami shaio 

founded in february marimba received its first round of venture  funding from the java fund handled by the venture capital firm of kleiner perkins caufield  byers
