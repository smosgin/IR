keep car cool
summer heat is hard on a cars interior  it can cause the headliner ceiling
fabric to droop the padded dash to crack and upholstery to fade

many summer related problems can be addressed with a little common sense  try
to park in the shade  avoid those wide open spaces that allow relentless full
time exposure to the sun

try to park near a building to assure your car of some shade at least part of
the time

finally purchase a sun shade  these inexpensive cardboard blockers placed in
the windshield and rear windows help lower the interior temperature

more tips on protecting your cars interior are in a free pamphlet `how to
keep your car looking young published by the car care council  send a
stamped self addressed envelope to the car care council dept n one grande
lake drive port clinton oh  43452
