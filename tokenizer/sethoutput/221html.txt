lowemission engines from russia

technology three different engines using different fuels hydrogen extracted within the engine from methanol using catalysis and the heat of the exhaust the axial engine which automatically changes piston stroke depending on load and comes in gasoline and diesel versions
markets automotive trucks small vehicles stationary engines aircraft
advantages the developers claim that the hydrogen engine can meet the zeroemissions requirement set for california and other states for 1998 by generating the hydrogen onboard no new distribution and storage system is needed alternatively the engine can run on methanol or other fuels directly carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are reduced by 99 and nox by 85 according to the developers
	the axial engine with its novel arrangement of five or seven cylinders can reduce fuel consumption by 3540 engine weight by 3040 and emissions by 4045 compared to similar horsepower 120130 gasoline engines at idle speeds the piston stroke is shortened resulting in 50 fuel economy
status us patents applied for available for license estimated cost to develop $320 million in 13 years
