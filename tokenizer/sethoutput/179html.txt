 a overview
 
 the italian market for pleasure motorboats including inboard inoutboard
 and pneumatic boats has experienced an exceptional growth during the
 quinquennium 1985  1990 surging two and a half times its sales volume  in
 1990 italian demand for pleasure motorboats reached the peak of its high
 development phase  this trend was even more accentuated by important laws
 issued by the italian parliament which somewhat alleviated tax burdens for
 pleasure motorboat owners  after this period of astonishing expansion the
 market has entered a new cycle characterized by stability and even an
 inflection in its growth rate  nonetheless this has not affected sector
 imports which in 1991 experienced a 37 increase in sales volume current
 terms and covered approximately 50 of the market demand  in particular
 us exports to italy continue to play a preponderant role maintaining an
 import market share of 380 and actually covering 19 of italian sector
 market  notwithstanding the partys over atmosphere prevailing among us
 domestic powerboat suppliers and a general slowdown currently affecting the
 european market the stars and stripes production costs about 20 less
 than the italian one and thus what is generally viewed as the us
 invasion is expected to continue with good sales for small and mediumsize
 inboardinoutboard and outboard motorboats and especially cabin cruisers
 and day cruisers

 c  market assessment
 
 1  market demand
 
 in europe the pleasure boat market has experienced a cyclic growth which
 reached in 1990 the peak of its high development phase  this trend was even
 more accentuated on the italian market after important laws issued by the
 italian parliament in 1989 which contributed to further boost its momentum
 in brief the inductive type of personal income assessment for italian
 resident boat owners became less substantial  in addition the value added
 tax one time doubled for boats over 18 tons was limited to boats over 50
 tons approximately 20 meters in length and a new category was created for
 small boat owners which pay a reduced vat more consistent with european
 levels  thus a 9 vat was applied to small boats under 3 ton and 6 meters
 and 185 kw a 19 vat applied to hulls up to 50 tons and a 38 vat to
 hulls over 50 tons  it is understandable how these laws have positively
 influenced the growth of the italian domestic pleasure boat market which
 chalked up an amazing increase of 150 from 1985 to 1990
 
 since 1990 yearend however the industry has been experiencing a slightly
 weaker demand for pleasure motorboats  several factors have contributed to
 this end including the decline in the overall economy with slower growth of
 personal income and the reluctance of pleasure boat consumers to take on
 additional debt skyrocketing mooring taxes and lack of an adequate
 infrastructure to support pleasure boating  a pleasure motorboat is by far
 a discretionary purchase that can be postponed or canceled  thus when the
 overall economy weakens the demand for pleasure boats also declines  the
 1991 introduction of outrageously expensive and differentiated annual
 mooring tax rates eg an eightmeter motorboat currently costs
 approximately $1000 instead of the previous $160 heavily contributed to
 dampen consumer purchases  many observers indicate that more affordable
 marinas and other infrastructures are also badly needed to boost mediumterm
 demand  nonetheless us products strongly desired by italian dealers and
 distributors because of their innovations special features and very
 competitive prices registered a further increase of 26 in 1991 sales to
 italy  italian demand for us pleasure motorboats is expected to fare well
 in the near future although it is not likely to reach the astonishing
 increases of the recent past
 
 2  end user profile
 
 thirty years ago there was one boat owner in italy every five thousand
 inhabitants  currently there is one boat owner every hundred  the future
 could perhaps envision one boat owner every 20  italy has after all a
 seafaring tradition coupled with acceptable weather all year round  in
 addition the market should benefit from the fastest growing 35to44 and
 45to54 age groups  the latter especially are reaching the maximum
 wageearning period allowing them to consider such large purchases as a
 pleasure boat
 
 pleasure motorboats sold in italy during 1990 last official figure
 available amounted to 4915 units for inboardinoutboard pleasure boats
 7459 units for outboard pleasure boats and 13267 for pneumatic boats
 totaling sales for $ 327 million  close to the same amount is estimated to
 have been sold in 1991 with a 50 increase in the import of the more
 comfortable mediumsize inboardinoutboard pleasure boats  in 1991
 italian demand for smaller units slightly decreased with 10 less imports
 of pneumatic boats and 5 less imports of outboard models notwithstanding
 the fact that the small motorboat segment is still by far the most popular
 or rather the more affordable
 diesel engines are predominant in the inboard and inoutboard
 configurations  this trend generalized all over europe is even more
 accentuated in italy  fuel economy cannot be considered an influencing
 factor due to low amount of hours per year of navigation for a pleasure
 boat  the dominant criterior is the safety factor for the same reason that
 the installation of two independent engines has become a standard at sea
 gasoline engine powered boats thanks to the increased safety factor of
 modern designed engines are also increasing their small market share and
 find favorable application in prestige high performance boats where high
 speed high power concentration and reduced bulk are taken as major design
 criteria  outboard engines are of course practically all gasoline fueled
 
 
 d  best sales prospects
 
 since a pleasure motorboat is considered a luxury item anyway it appears
 that the sale of commodious boats such as mediumsize cabin cruisers and
 the more popular smallsize day cruisers 7 to 8 meters long
 inboardinoutboards is expected to keep up  at the same time
 manufacturers are expected to continue offering smaller units both for
 logistical and economical factors to appeal to new boating enthusiasts
 entering the market  however there is a weak request at the moment for
 runabouts
 
 regarding the engines the propeller system seems to be still the most
 popular and efficient system as long as the propeller is properly designed
 for the hull and engine characteristics  waterjets are somewhat increasing
 their penetration both in the small and high power segments  while more
 appropriate for larger and faster boats jet propulsion is well suited to
 small boats for special applications such as coast guard fire brigades and
 safe approach of populated beaches where efficiency of the propulsion system
 is of secondary importance in respect to safety and practical factors
 
 
 e  competitive situation
 
 1  domestic production
 
 the italian market for pleasure motorboats is split almost fiftyfifty among
 foreign and domestic suppliers  there are approximately 600 shipyards in
 italy all italian of which about 200 cover 70 of total italian sales
 among these are renowned names such as abbate azimut baglietto rio and
 riva  the remaining 400 are small artisantype enterprises  italian
 shipyards have an average export share of over 65 of their total billing
 but in the high prestige segment this share exceeds 9095 with some
 shipyards working exclusively for the export market  high technology style
 according to the worldfamous italian design of the hull line and vessel
 interiors are the main reasons for achieving a high share of this market
 where price competition becomes a factor of secondary importance
 
 the propulsion systems selected by italian shipyards for powering their
 pleasure boats appear very international  italian engine manufacturers are
 present all along the line with diesel and gasoline fueled engines
 successfully exported all over the world  on the other hand italian
 shipyards select the engine according to customer and boatbuilder
 requirements often selecting engines imported from the united states
 germany sweden etc  this makes importexport figures very high on both
 sides  italian engines used by italian shipyards are mainly inboard engines
 in the lower power bracket both diesel and gasoline to mention just a few
 ivecoaifo bpm while in the mediumhigh power bracket the swedish volvo
 penta and the american detroit diesel and caterpillar have the highest
 market share  the german man and mtu are the most popular for engines up to
 1000 kw and above used on luxury yachts
 
 in 1990 the italian market demand increased approximately 45 with domestic
 production rising 31 from previous year  domestic sales surged 39
 chalking up approximately $210 million while exports rose 27 totaling $367
 million  the slight inflection in the 1991 market demand was strongly
 covered by foreign producers to the detriment of domestic ones whose
 production dropped an estimated 16 with consequent sales falling both
 domestically an estimated 23 and abroad 12
 
 2  imports
 
 in 1990 imports of pleasure motorboats totaled $117 million and accounted
 for 36 of the total market  in 1991 they reached $153 million covering
 half of the italian market  while 1990 imports rose 57 compared to
 previous year in 1991 they increased 37 which is still obviously
 remarkable but less than previous year due to the slight inflection in
 market demand and to the fact that there was perhaps a readjustment by
 italian boat dealers who had an excess supply after the large increases of
 the past  in addition to us suppliers which take the lions share for
 imported craft countries which have the strongest presence are uk
 representing 166 of total imports france with 126 especially strong
 in the sale of pneumatic boats and germany 65  imports are expected
 to continue to play a key role in the next few years
 
 3  us market position and share
 
 not only is the us italys principal supplier but italy is the fourth
 largest customer in size of destination countries after canada japan and
 germany  in 1990 us imports amounted to approximately $48 million plus
 54 compared to previous year representing 41 of total imports and 15
 of total market  in 1991 us sales in italy chalked up $58 million plus
 26 representing 380 of total imports and accounting for 19 of the
 italian market  in particular the us respectively supplied 37 and 51
 of imported inboardinoutboard pleasure boats and outboard motorboats
 well over one hundred us motorboat manufacturers are present on the
 italian market through local importersdistributors  the latter include
 champion record international yachts marina di verbella marine union
 motomar yachting vitalco and many others
 
 many consider the us as the leader in the pleasure boating industry
 reflecting this trend us firms are traditionally the most numerous among
 foreign exhibitors at the renowned annual genoa international boat show
 many observers at the show have commented that the stars and stripes
 production costs about 20 less than the italian one and some members of
 ucina italian boating manufacturers association are really beginning to
 fear what is generally looked at as the us invasion of the market
 
 because us pleasure boat production enjoys such an excellent receptivity
 the us import market share for the next three years is expected to keep up
 with an estimated annual real growth of about 5  it is unlikely however
 that it will be able to repeat the amazing performances of the recent past
 in the short term in view of the general recession currently affecting
 italian economy with the consequent drop of consumer expenditures in the
 more trivial sectors
 
 4  competitive factors
 
 competitive prices reputation service and the ability to meet specific
 client needs for the optional equipment as well as timely delivery are the
 winning factors for selling us sector products in italy a newtomarket
 us supplier should strongly consider participating in the annual genoa
 international boat show traditionally held around the third week of
 october  it is truly considered one of the best if not the most
 prestigious boat shows in the world  since the boat show is held in the
 fall trade participation is very highdrawing under a single roof
 approximately 1400 exhibitors of which 35 are foreign participants and
 330000 visitorsand much of the annual business is transacted in genoa as
 dealers begin to build stock for the spring sales season
 
 
 f  market access
 
 1  import climate
 
 in italy pleasure boats flying the italian flag with a gross tonnage of
 more than 3 tons an engine power greater than 184 kw and with
 unrestricted service must be registered in records which are kept by the
 port authorities  upon registration the boat is given an identification
 number and a document which allows it to sail  in order to obtain this
 registration the boat has to comply with strict technical safety
 requirements which are checked by means of a survey and tests  the italian
 naval register rina is authorized by the italian maritime administration
 to carry out the above
 
 in order to avoid repeating the same tests on all identical boats the law
 allows the above tests to be carried out on a prototype  upon satisfactory
 completion of these tests rina issues an document of approval called
 homologation certificate  regarding the actual procedure the following
 drawings of the boat are to be sent to rina head office in genoa for
 examination and approval  structural drawings drawings showing engine
 installation fuel and bilge systems electric plant and drawings of the
 rudder and shaft brackets  once the drawings are examined they are
 returned to the shipyards agent sometimes with recommendations to be
 complied with  a physical survey is then carried by one of the rina
 surveyors in the us or directly by a surveyor from italy  the surveyor
 reports his findings to the head office in genoa which if satisfactory
 issues the homologation certificate  as previously stated the certificate
 covers all the mass production of a certain model of pleasure boat
 
 prototypes of boat components which must be homologated include propulsion
 engines nonmetallic parts of fuel systems including non metallic tanks
 fans and blowers for gasoline motor propelled boats and fire
 extinguishers  there is no compulsory requirement for hull materials
 
 once a model has been homologated it is no longer necessary to submit all
 the others belonging to the same series to the tests already mentioned  it
 is sufficient to provide the maritime authority with a copy of the
 homologation certificate on the back of which there must be a written
 declaration signed no longer by the us manufacturer but by his italian
 agent stating that the product is built in conformity with the prototype  a
 new requirement dated july 30 1991 issued by the italian maritime
 administration states that foreign shipyards who wish to homologate their
 prototypes for sale in italy must have a legal agent resident in italy
 this agent must be authorized by the shipyard to carry out the
 homologation procedure on behalf of the foreign shipyard  moreover this
 agent will indeed have to sign on behalf of the shipyard the statement of
 conformity for the massproduced boats
 
 for additional specifics us suppliers should contact rina see address in
 key contacts list
 
 2  distributionbusiness practices
 
 domestic producers usually sell directly to the endusers  imported
 products are generally retailed by distributors who carry a full spectrum of
 product lines  these importers tend to represent more than one
 manufacturer frequently three or four each one specialized in a
 specific product segment  there are presently approximately 3000
 distribution outlets in italy  the more prestigious yachts are sold through
 brokers
 
 as previously stated the italian government recently announced that only
 italian citizens can act as agents for signing off on the homologation
 standards compliance documents  this means that factory personnel of
 nonitalian boat manufacturers imported into italy cannot sign off on the
 paperwork  quite often it is the italian dealers or distributors who signs
 off and these people are italian citizens  however if the manufacturer
 terminates the italian dealer or distributor that party owns the
 homologation and may charge the manufacturer a royalty for import on behalf
 of the new dealer or distributor  alternatively the manufacturer can go
 through the expensive homologation procedure anew
 
 the us national marine manufacturers associatin nmma has made a adhoc
 third party available as the required citizen homologation agent for any
 nmma boat builder who can act on behalf of multiple boat companies meeting
 their requirements of italian citizenship for the agent but without the
 downside difficulties of terminating a dealer or distributor who acts as
 homologation agent  for further information us suppliers should contact
 nmma see address in key contacts list
 
 list of italian distributors and agents can be obtained through the us
 department of commerce district offices from our commercial information
 management systems database cims and the national trade data bank ntdb
 intersted companies may also request through the same channels and
 agentdistribution service ads or a comparison shopping service css
 both offer excellent valueformoney contacts and market information
 
 3  financing
 
 payments by importers are usually in cash or in maximum 60 days with a
 letter of credit  it is very difficult to establish the markup imposed by
 local distributorsimporters as it greatly varies depending on the type of
 product  since us products are in great demand because of their
 competitive consumer prices it is deemed that the average markup is not
 very high and that dealers prefer to rely on selling  large quantities
