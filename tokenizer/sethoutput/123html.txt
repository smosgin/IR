worn shocks can sneak up on you


have you ever noticed how quickly you can become accustomed to an annoying
shake or rattle  you may forget its there until the condition becomes
serious  worn shock absorbers or struts are a classic example of the kind of
deterioration that warrants early attention  the first indication of pending
failure of these critical parts is when the vehicle dives when brakes are
applied sways on turns or bottoms out on a bumpy road

a visual inspection under the car often discloses potential trouble such as a
leaking or damaged shock or worn parts such as rubber bushings

the car care council warns that weak shocks andor struts lead to poor ride
control which affects more than comfort  its a safety factor as well
