cold numbers










thanks to john evans for the banner

what is cold numbers
cold numbers is a fan created set of cards for on the edge  when a number of us learned that the 
	expansion formerly known as wetworks tefka ww was put on hold by atlas games we decided to
	satisfy our need for new cards ourselves  the name was spawned from the subject of a letter 
	from john nephew explaining why tefka ww wasnt possible anyone have a copy of that letter
there is a mailing list on which we discuss the set  you can subscribe to it by sending a message to
	macjordomofenrisitsilstuedu with an empty subject
	line and subscibe coldnumbers yourrealname in the first line of the message
	alternatively you can deal with a real human being at 
	mrsbrinkerfenrisitsilstuedu
the digests of the list are stored at  the digest storage
	depot
all the cards so far designed can be found at the 
cold numbers web page
