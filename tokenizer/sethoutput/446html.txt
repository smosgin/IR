suspected nucleardealer attended clinton fundraiser

by christopher ruddy>
for the tribunereview  103096

washington  why did president bill clinton meet with grigori
loutchansky a man whose company the current cia director has
told congress is an organization associated with russian
criminal activity

that question has a number of national security experts who
are concerned about loutchansky and nordex  an international
company which has been linked to the smuggling of nuclear
materials  wondering in october of 1993 loutchansky was
invited to the us to attend a private fundraising dinner
for the democratic national committee where loutchansky met
with the president the meeting was memorialized in the
latvian newspaper sm today on nov 12 1993

in 1995 though loutchansky was still a priority concern for
us intelligence he was again invited by the dnc to attend
another fundraising dinner with the president disclosures
about loutchansky come on the heels of questions about dealings
the president and the dnc have had with businessmen from
indonesia south korea and taiwan earlier this month
republicans sharply criticized the president for meeting with
a miami drug dealer after he had made a $20000 donation to
democratic coffers

nordex connections

time magazine in an expose on loutchansky only three months
ago reported that nordex based in vienna and moscow has been
one of the top intelligence targets in the west since nordex
was formed in 1989 to trade russian commodities and natural
resources with the west allegations have surfaced that the firm
has been involved in money laundering narcotics trafficking
arms deals and other russian mafia criminal activities
loutchansky a former professor and latvian university official
who once served a twoyear term in prison for embezzlement has
not been charged with any crimes in russia or elsewhere since
he founded nordex

according to a secret german intelligence report nordex was
created by the old soviet regime with the aim of bringing
foreign currency accumulated by the kgb and top communist party
officials into the west as well as a means to continue earning
hard currency for russian intelligence organizations domestic
intelligence sources believe numerous such companies were created
for that purpose but nordex with its $3 billion in annual
business appears to be the largest such concern operating in
the west

nordex also may be the most dangerous in the spring of 1995
ukrainian officials in kiev inspected a nordexowned cargo plane
that had emanated in north korea and was destined for iraq the
aircraft was carrying scud missile warheads

suspicions too have been raised about nuclear smuggling to
rogue states like iran iraq and north korea according to time
in the past three years the national security agency has
found indications that nordex has been engaged on the black
market with nuclear materials christopher story editor of
the londonbased soviet analyst  the onetime british foreign
office newsletter on russian matters  told the tribunereview
that sources in british intelligence believe nordex is a rapidly
proliferating amoeba or cancer constantly replicating and
mutating into a network of business fronts engaged in enterprises
ultimately controlled by russian intelligence nordex controls
more than 100 russian firms and has more than three dozen businesses
in the west

second invitation

in an unpublished extensive interview with time magazine excerpts
of which the tribunereview has obtained loutchansky explained
how he ended up meeting with clinton i was invited by a friend
of mine  sam domb  he was a trustee sic of the democratic
national committee  to take part in a dinner which was given by
mr clinton and mr gore and 20 senators  in october 1993
it was in washington in some museum  i was invited as an
outstanding jewish businessman

loutchansky went on to say he spoke privately with the president
for about two minutes discussing the problems of nuclear missiles
in the ukraine loutchansky also told the jerusalem report he
agreed to a request from the president to deliver a private message
to the leader of the ukraine new york businessman sam domb told
the tribunereview he has no idea who loutchansky was and had never
met him before the dinner domb apparently agitated by the call
had no explanation as to why he was photographed with loutchansky
and clinton or why he was previously quoted extensively in a
russian emigre newspaper praising loutchansky

according to federal election commission records in the months
immediately following the october 1993 washington dinner domb
donated $90000 to the dnc in the past three years he has forked
over $155000 to the committee loutchansky has stated he never
donated any money to the democratic party or the clintongore
campaign federal law prohibits donations by foreign individuals
or companies to political candidates or parties sometimes
foreigners try to skirt the law by having american citizens make
donations on their behalf there is no evidence that has occurred
here but loutchansky has a track record in russia and elsewhere
of showering officials with money and gifts for favors and access
for instance time located a dummy swiss company owned by nordex
called dorotel ag which according to a nordex official was nothing
more than a bank account used to make discreet payments for
friends of nordex 

calls to the democratic national committee for comment as to why
loutchansky was invited to a fundraising dinner for the president
and why loutchansky according to a source familiar with the case
received a letter from the president thanking him for his support
went unreturned also unexplained is the invitation loutchansky
received just last year from the democratic national committee for
a vip dinner with clinton dear mr loutchansky wrote dnc finance
director richard sullivan i cordially invite you to have dinner
with president clinton on tuesday july 11 1995 at the hay adams
hotel in washington dc

loutchansky told the jerusalem report he did not go to that event
because he feared us officials would not allow him to enter the
country already loutchansky has been barred from britain and canada
soviet analyst editor story suggested loutchanskys meeting and
invitations to see clinton were nothing short of scandal its
preposterous to believe loutchansky came once to meet the president
and was invited again without giving some benefit or receiving
some in kind story said
