optimal estimation and control a fresh look





a controversial and important  allnew five day course from one of the outstanding authorities in the field
january 1317 1997 cocoa beach fl









what you will learn

that lqg and kalman theory are history what the new theory is all about where its likely to go and how to use it to design your own regulators and observers


who should attend

estimation and controls practitioners who wish to get much better performance from their systems by merely using better feedback gain matrices
those interested in continuing the research  

while the material is heavily mathematical the essential ideas in statistics power spectra and matrix algebra and calculus will all be covered



summary

lqg theory for regulators and kalman theory for observers both require you to believe that all process and measurement noise is white and gaussian when no physical noise has either property  further lqg theory forces you to accept that minimizing the trace of a weighted covariance of the state variables is whats good for you while kalman theory relies on minimizing the trace of the measurement error weighted residuals whose relation to engineering desires is tenuous at best  this course is designed to show you how to design optimal regulators and observers for stationary systems based on knowledge of the all the noise power spectra and using performance measures that are much more sensitive to your actual engineering needs  you will also see that by your own measure performance is likely to be greatly improved relative to lqg or kalmanderived feedback gains  while several papers and seminars have been given on this subject this is the first course offered on how to do it along with the current status of the theory  throughout obscure matrix relations are introduced as needed  caveat this theory is all analog  its the oversampling limit of a system with infinite computational resources  a discussion will be given on directions for future research

instructor
david sonnabend phd pe has over 40 years experience in space systems controls and estimation instrument design and navigation including 16 years at jpl  he is currently the president of analytical engineering  this course has evolved over the last several years from various studies papers and seminars to the point where the book describing the new theory regulators observers and power spectra has just been published  dr sonnabend is presently engaged in extending that work  he holds a ba in physics from ucla and an ms and phd in engineering from stanford university  he is also a registered professional engineer in colorado
