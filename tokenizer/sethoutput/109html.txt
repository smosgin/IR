cooling system

tuneup checklist

flush dirt bugs and leaves from front of radiator with a brush and garden
hose
inspect the radiator cap  replace it if the rubber gasket is broken dried
out or missing
check the condition and level of coolant  if it is rusty clean the system
and replace with a 5050 mixture of water and ethylene glycol antifreeze
inspect radiator and radiator hoses for leaks cracks or soft mushy
condition  tighten all clamps  replace hoses as needed
look for the heater hose running from the engine through the firewall to
the heater core under the dash  replace swollen or cracked hoses  to check
the hoses start the engine and turn on the heater  if after ten minutes the
hoses are cool they could be clogged
inspect all engine belts for wear and cracks  replace if worn cracked or
glazed  adjust loose belts  note  some engines have a vribbed belt that
drives some or all of the accessories  if the belt grooves show excessive
cracks or chunking replace the belt
check the thermostat operation by running the engine for 1015 minutes
generally its ok if you can feel warm coolant surging through the upper hose
beware of an engine that runs too hot or too cool  tighten loose bolts on the
thermostat housing at the engine
clean the engine exterior  excessive oil and dirt will hide leaks or
insulate the engine causing it to run hot
