 a overview
 
 over the past few years the uae has developed into a popular base for
 businessmen tourists and industrialists alike
 
 worldwide the uae and dubai in particular is becoming known as an ideal
 location for trade investment distribution and manufacturing operations as
 well as a firstclass holiday destination featuring many of the finest
 leisure facilities available anywhere in the world
 
 the seafaring traditions of the gulf are well known and even though
 traditional sailing ships dhows continue to ply their trade across the
 arabian gulf todays vessels are dominated by the power boats and pleasure
 craft which have become very popular in the uae  given the coastline
 attributes of this part of the world it is hardly surprising that
 watersports should be such a popular pasttime here
 
 a number of us pleasure craft firms are represented in the uae such as
 the boston whaler glastron bayliner chapparal and larson but us firms
 can still find capable businessmen interested in generating sales for
 products new to this market  the water jet ski has become very popular in
 the uae and is a fast moving product line
 
 
 b  market assessment
 
 the uaes pleasure craft market is based on the desire of individual
 nationalsexpatriates to have their own pleasure craft  the sea is
 accessible within an hours drive for the majority of the residents of the
 uae  local production is of a very high standard and offers quality at a
 very competitive price  exports of local manufacture are made on a regular
 basis to all the gcc countries and even to france the maldive islands and
 finland
 
 the uae has a long coastline with no lakes or inland waterways  therefore
 all pleasure craft are used in the sea and most models purchased are
 seagoing vessels  traditionally low budget boat owners had to be content
 with small rowboats which were sometimes fitted with an inboard or outboard
 engine  today they have the option to purchase inflatable boats or small
 crafts which are light fast and reliable  lightweight boats are ideal for
 easy transport  however inflatable boats are not very popular here as they
 are not very good for use on the open sea under rough weather conditions
 these are mainly used for scuba diving  another factor which works against
 inflatable boats is price  a good quality inflatable boat with accessories
 could cost almost the same as a small craft manufactured locally
 
 between 1988 and 1990 annual imports of pleasure crafts to the uae grew from
 us $ 53 million to us $ 137 million an average annual rate of 60 per
 year  the markets growth is expected to continue at an estimated average
 of 50 over the next 23 years
 
 total uae imports during 19881990 were
 
 1988    us $ 532 million of which $ 19 million was for yachts and other
         pleasure vessels and $ 33 million for commercial vessels
 
 1989    us $ 82 million of which $ 32 million was for yachts and other
         pleasure vessels and $ 50 million for commercial vessels
 
 1990    us $ 136 million of which $ 45 million was for yachts and other
         pleasure vessels and $ 91 million for commercial vessels
 
 the uaes total market for pleasure craft in 1990 was estimated to be nearly
 us $ 272 million  it is estimated that approximately 50 percent of this
 market demand is met by local production  the total market appears to have
 an annual growth rate of over 50
 
 locally manufactured boats are popular as they are of a very high quality
 and available at very competitive prices  at present there is a joint
 venture between a british company and a local company  another japanese
 firm yamaha have just started a joint venture with their local agents
 building their own boats in dubai with production starting early september
 1992  market sources predict that boat prices will drop in the near future
 due to the stiff competition of these joint venture operations in the uae
 
 though boats manufactured locally are of a very high standard the local
 market in itself is not very big  market sources estimate that
 approximately 60 of these boats are exported to other gulf countries
 including saudi arabia kuwait and bahrain  it speaks volumes when one
 considers that some scandinavian countries are buying boats which are
 manufactured in the uae as it is comparable to those manufactured in
 europe  it is cheaper to produce a boat locally than in europe due to low
 cost labor  the main deterrent to increased export sales to ec countries is
 high custom duties levied on nonec manufacturers
 
 american boats are not price competitive in the uae any more when you take
 into consideration high shipping charges  american companies will have to
 seriously consider setting up joint ventures or their own manufacturing
 plants in the uae if they want to maintainincrease market share
 
 the important factors which have a bearing on who succeeds in this market
 are price service promotion and commitment to the local agent  support
 and quick response from suppliers are essential to success
 
 boat rental firms have been operating in the uae for approximately 2 years
 in popular demand for hire are water jet skis
 
 
 c  competitive situation
 
 in the coming years us exporters will be well advised not to ignore
 several new competitors that have appeared on the scene and are working to
 increase their market share
 
 during the period 19881990 the us share and its major competitors stood
 as follows
 
                 uk     italy     us     pakistan     taiwan      japan
                                                                    
 1988           347              4969       1497                  924
 1989          1485      3322    1976       100                   397
 1990          2584      2421    2265       1019       382        365
 
 domestic production
 
 the domestic boat industry is mediumsized and only directs 40 percent of
 its output to the local market  the other 60 are exported mainly to saudi
 arabia kuwait bahrain oman qater with a small percentage to france the
 maldive islands and finland
 
 there are currently approximately 40 boatbuilders in the entire uae
 however the local shipyards are handicapped by the lack of a national motor
 manufacturer which affects their competitiveness  for example of the us
 $4365 outboard engine motors sold in 1990 all were imported
 
 us firms such as scat hovercraft sunfishlaser inc wildcat watercraft
 performance catamarans inc boston whaler glastron chapparal have a
 presence in the uae market  their major competitors are kawasaki and yamaha
 of japan bombardier seadoo from canada  most firms carry a limited volume
 of stock while some act only as suppliers  when local firms act as
 suppliers they usually place orders with the company only after they receive
 an order from a customer  on an average showrooms in dubai have on display
 56 crafts of local manufacture and 35 different kinds of water jet skis
 
 according to industry contacts the advantage that us firms used to enjoy
 based on quality reputation and service is fast being eroded as prices
 which have always been an important factor are no longer competitive
 
 promotion is also important but boat enthusiasts appear quite knowledgeable
 about the subject from reading reports and tests in foreign boat magazines
 local sources say that a boating magazine being prepared in the uae is in
 the offing
 
 for all cases including pleasure boats and marine engines all
 distributors agents provide service through their workshop and usually
 offer a 6 month to a oneyear guarantee  local manufacturers generally
 offer a 2 year guarantee for the hull  effective and well organized service
 is considered to be very important
 
 cost is an important competitive factor particularly in the lower to
 uppermiddle pricerange of the pleasure craft market  price is less of a
 consideration at the top end of the market where purchasers are less likely
 to be concerned about discretionary income and expenditures
 
 other key competitive factors in the pleasure craft market are durability
 safety quality style design speed capacity and accessories  it is not
 easy to sell a used boat in the uae so the resale value is not a very
 important factor when buying a new boat though local market sources say that
 it is not uncommon for a local manufacturer of repute to be approached for
 boats which have been traded in for newer and faster models
 
 
 d  market access
 
 the commercial climate in the uae is one of free trade and competitiveness
 
 there are no impediments to entering the market nor are there any laws
 regulating the imports of pleasure craft  english is the commercial
 language alongside arabic but arabic takes precedence in official documents
 with government departments
 
 normal working hours are from 0730 or 0800 to 1330 except thursday when
 they close at 1200 for all government and public institutions municipal
 offices banks etc while the private sector resumes for an afternoon
 session usually from around 1600 to 1930  some companies in the private
 sector have a five day week with the weekends usually being thursday and
 friday or friday and saturday  all government business must be accomplished
 during the five morning hours  it is not unusual for a civil servant to
 operate a private business during evening hours  no offices open for
 friday the day of rest
 
 in order to enter the uae market us firms must appoint an agent or a
 distributor  local representation is a legal condition for doing business
 in the market  however care is advised in the selection of an agent  in
 selection of an agent  us suppliers are reminded that the uae federal
 agency law no 18 of 1981 and its 1989 amendments are applicable and should
 be reviewed carefully prior to appointing a local agent  the agency law
 favors the local traders and cancellation of agency agreements and contracts
 are difficult and costly regardless of the severance clauses included
 frequent visits and strong agent support by the manufacturer both before and
 after the sale are the basic ingredients for success  the usfcs can assist
 in identifying reputable representatives
 
 local sources say that the us market share has been lost partly due to
 lack of loyalty on the part of american companies to the local agent  it is
 important to bear in mind that agentsdistributors spend a lot of time and
 money in promoting a product in this area and when the product gains
 popularity and an agency agreement has been signed any inquiry received by
 the us firm directly from any individualcompany from the uae should be
 routed through the local agent
 
 duty for import of pleasure craft is the usual 2
 
 pleasure crafts are not presently required to be registered in the uae
 local market sources say that very shortly the uae federal ministry will be
 enforcing all owners of pleasure crafts in the uae to have their boats
 registered  they expect this to be put in effect by end this year
 
 distribution and business practices  domestic manufacturers sell through
 distributors and also directly to end users  imported boats are generally
 retailed by distributors who carry a full spectrum of product lines  these
 importers tend to represent more than one manufacturer frequently three or
 four specializing in a specific product segment  the ability to meet
 specific client needs for optional equipment timely delivery as well as
 price are important factors to consider when selling us pleasure crafts in
 the uae
 
 no safety standards are set locally but the trend is to go by the standards
 set by the us coastguard
 
 approximately 10 marinas are in the uae which are usually run by the large 5
 star hotels or by boat clubs  charges for mooring are high and vary in
 price from marina to marina  the charge is usually based on footage and on
 average could cost us $ 1635 per annum for a boat upto 20 feet  this
 charge apart from mooring the boat would usually include maintenance boat
 washing and sometimes even battery charge
 
 many people who do not want to pay the high costs of berthing their boats at
 marinas moor them on buoys at sea or keep them on trailers outside their
 homes  sailing boats can also be kept on beaches  public slipways for
 launching powerboats are available
