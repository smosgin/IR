	entech engineering inc was contracted by the city of reading to undertake a $26 million renovation of the citys antiquated water system  a total of 72 separate projects was completed  major elements of the renovation project include

	18th ward 4 tank replacement  entech provided all engineering design and construction monitoring for this $15 million finished water storage tank  the new 23 million gallon tank was constructed adjacent to the authoritys old 1930 era riveted steel lead painted storage tank which was dismantled as part of the project

	entech conducted a detailed evaluation of steel vs concrete tank type using a lifecycle cost analysis which took into account first costs and ongoingfuture maintenance expenditures  plans and specifications were then prepared for construction of a 77 ft diameter 66 ft high posttensioned concrete tank  also included in the project was the  addition of an altitude valve associated bypass piping isolation valves and instrumentation all contained in an underground vault

	filter plant renovations  provided mechanical civil structural electrical and architectural engineering design and construction inspection services for over $80 million worth of construction projects at the maiden creek filter plant

	projects included 1 concrete and structural repairs for the coagulation channels settling basins and raw water conduits 2 replacement of existing substation and distribution system 3 electrical system upgrades to the entire building including indoor and outdoor lighting 4 chlorine injection modifications and aqua ammonia feed system and bulk storage 5 new carbon feed system 6 replacement of dehumidification equipment 7 boiler burner replacement 8 new filter and backwash control system including motorized valves and electronic filter controls 9 new traveling water screen and bulkhead replacement 10 replacement of sand filter media 11 new fiberglass reinforced sluice gates 12 hydroelectric unit design and startuptesting

	chlorineammonia building modifications prepared plans and specifications for the installation of a multi oneton cylinder chlorine system complete with two new scales 2 oneton cylinders per scale an evaporator for implementation of liquid andor gas chlorination a 6000 gallon aqua ammonia tank and two new metering pumps  building renovations were designed to correct the pennsylvania department of environmental protections code violations pertaining to the separation of feedstorage and adequate ventilation with chlorine sensors for personnel safety

	bulk lime silo system  provided layout design plans and specifications for the installation of a 30ton hydrated lime silo system slurry pumps trenchingpiping foundation and controls

	clearwater basin repairs provided mechanical civil and structural engineering design and construction inspection services for over $10 million worth of construction repair projects at the 10 mg underground clearwater basins  projects included partial floor slab removal and replacement construction joint repairs and protection involving the installation of a flexible hypalon liner system installation of two 30 emergency backup discharge pipe lines and associated valving and coordination of lime sludge removal and drying operations

	also conducted complete structural analyses of column supports ceiling arches and foundations and evaluated flow rates capacity chlorine contact time and water quality

	distribution system upgrades entech developed plans and specifications for a multitude of improvementsupgrades to the citys 209 mile distribution system  entech designed and inspected over 30000 lf of water main ranging in size from 6 to 36  the distribution system upgrades include the elimination of dead ends via looping replacing existing deteriorated and undersized mains with new larger diameter pipe fire hydrant replacements main line distribution valve replacements 30 and 36 sizes etc 

	in addition entech worked extensively with padot conrail and the pennsylvania dep to ensure proper permitting and safety of installation examples of other distribution system projects include transferring of services from low pressure to intermediate pressure new pressure reducing valves aerial and underground stream crossings cathodic protection and the development of an operational pipe flow model of the entire distribution system  total construction costs for the distribution system upgrades are in excess of $63 million

	maiden creek pumping station upgrades upgrade of the pumping station included structural and roof repairs replacement of underground fuel tanks new 900 hp diesel engine and speed reducer for a 17 mgd emergency pump new pump discharge valvesoperators pump surge anticipatorrelief system new vacuum system electrical system upgrades including new switchgear lighting and emergency power system electrification of an existing crane and new automated pump controls including a scada control system  entech also provide structural analysis of crane and building supports evaluation of electrical heating and pump control systems pump flow tests and flow metering calibration and an energy study to reduce electrical consumption during peak hours
	
	hydraulic flow model entech developed a hydraulic model to simulate pipe network flow analysis of the citys 13 mgd system consisting of 210 miles of 4 to 36 water mains four pressure zones three pumping stations each with two to five pumps four pressure sustaining valves and eleven water tanksreservoirs ranging in  size from 500000 to 26000000 gallons

	scada reading had a very old unreliable centralized reservoir monitoring system to track tank water levels  this system was replaced with a state of the art supervisory control and data acquisition scada system which allows the city to accurately track and record not only tank levels but also filter plant performance filter status flows turbidities etc  transmissiondistribution system pressures residual chlorine and ph levels transmission line flows pump suction and discharge pressures and other data continuously  operational control and status of pumps and storage tank altitude valves is also provided  over 350 points are monitored or controlled by the system

	gis  a geographic information system gis was developed for the city to quickly access distribution and service information on the computer  the system also contains fire hydrant valve and line details in a comprehensive database which is easily accessed over conventional phone lines  work orders and inventory tracking are an integral part of the system
