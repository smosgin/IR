what is sircxsar

sircxsar stands for  spaceborne imaging radarcxband synthetic aperture
radar sircxsar is an imaging radar system scheduled for launch aboard the
nasa space shuttle in 1994 it consists of a radar antenna structure and
associated radar system hardware that is designed to fit inside the space
shuttles cargo bay on takeoff the cargo bay doors are closed as seen in the
graphic on the next page after the space shuttle has reached a stable earth
orbit the cargo bay doors will be opened  the antenna structure will be
deployed and sircxsar will be switched on to begin using its
stateoftheart radar technology to image the earths surface radar images
generated by sircxsar will be used by scientists to help understand some of
the processes which affect the earths environment such as deforestation in
the amazon desertification south of the sahara and soil moisture retention in
the midwest

the sircxsar project

	sircxsar is a joint project of the national aeronautics and space
administration nasa the german space agency dara and the italian space
agency asi it is the next step in a series of spaceborne imaging radars
beginning with seasat in 1978 continuing with sira 1981 germanys
microwave remote sensing experiment 1983 and sirb 1984 it is a precursor
to the earth observing system eos imaging radar system planned for the end of
the decade 

science objectives

	sircxsars unique contributions to earth observation and monitoring are its
capability to measure from space the radar signature of the surface at three
different wavelengths and to make measurements for different polarizations at
two of those wavelengths sirc image data will help scientists understand the
physics behind some of the phenomena seen in radar images at just one
wavelengthpolarization such as those produced by seasat investigators on the
sircxsar science team will use the radar image data from sircxsar to make
measurements of the following


vegetation type extent and deforestation
soil moisture content
ocean dynamics wave and surface wind speeds and directions
volcanism and tectonic activity
soil erosion and desertification



sircxsar instrument description


	the sircxsar antenna structure actually consists of three individual
antennas one operating at lband 235cm wavelength one at cband 58cm
wavelength and the third at xband 3cm wavelength the lband and cband
antennas are constructed from separate panels that can measure both horizontal
and vertical polarizations



	the sircxsar antenna is the most massive piece of hardware at a total of
10500 kilograms ever assembled at the jet propulsion laboratory and measures
12 meters by 4 meters the sirc instrument was built by jpl and the ball
communication systems division for nasa and provides the lband and cband
measurements at different polarizations the lband and cband antennas employ
phased array technology which allows the antenna beam pointing to be adjusted
electronically the xsar  instrument is built by the dornier and  alenia
spazio companies for dara and asi and operates at a single frequency xband
the xsar antenna is a slotted waveguide type which uses a mechanical tilt to
change the beam pointing direction 


sircxsar image data

	during a weeklong shuttle flight sircxsar will image an area of roughly
50 million square kilometers of the earths surface this corresponds to a
total of 50 hours of data the peak data rate will be 225 megabits or
225000000 bits per second the data collected will be processed into images
with resolution selectable from 10 to 200 meters the width of the area mapped
out by the radar will vary from 15 to 90 kilometers depending on how the radar
is operated and the direction in which the antenna beams are pointing data
from sircxsar will be used to develop automatic techniques for extracting
information from radar image data in preparation for the eos sar mission later
in the decade

the ground and mapping out a swath as the shuttle moves forward the area

more about sircxsar

	the shuttle imaging radarc and xband synthetic aperture radar sircxsar
is a cooperative space shuttle experiment between the national aeronautics and
space administration nasa the german space agency dara and the italian
space agency asi  the experiment is the next step forward in nasas
spaceborne imaging radar sir program that began with the seasat synthetic
aperture radar sar in 1978 and continued with sira in 1981 and sirb in
1984 the program will eventually lead to topsat a mission to measure
topography globally and the earth observing system eos sar later in this
decade  the program also benefits from experience gained with the magellan
mission to venus other international spaceborne radar programs eg ers1
jers1 and prototype aircraft sensors such as the jpl airborne sar
airsar

	sirc will provide increased capability over seasat sira and sirb by
acquiring digital images simultaneously at two microwave wavelengths
lambda l band lambda = 235 cm and cband lambda = 58 cm
these vertically and horizontallypolarized transmitted waves will be received
on two separate channels so that sirc will provide images of the magnitude of
radar backscatter for four polarization combinations hh
horizontallytransmitted horizontallyreceived vv verticallytransmitted
verticallyreceived hv and vh and also data on the relative phase
difference between the hh vv vh and hv returns  this allows derivation of
the complete scattering matrix of a scene on a pixel by pixel basis  from this
scattering matrix every polarization configuration linear circular or
elliptical can be generated during ground processing  the radar polarimetric
data will yield more detailed information about the surface geometric
structure vegetation cover and subsurface discontinuities than image
brightness alone  

	germanys imaging radar program started with the microwave remote sensing
experiment mrse flown aboard the shuttle  this xband radar was flown on the
first spacelab mission in 1983  the program was continued by development of
the xsar for which cooperation with italy was initiated  xsar will operate
at xband lambda = 31 cm with vv polarization resulting in a
threefrequency capability for the total sircxsar system  because radar
backscatter is most strongly influenced by objects comparable in size to the
radar wavelength this multifrequency capability will provide information
about the earths surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with
previous singlewavelength experiments

sircxsar instrumentation

	sirc will provide multifrequency multipolarization radar data  the sirc
instrument is composed of several subsystems the antenna array the
transmitter the receivers the datahandling subsystem and the ground sar
processor  the antenna is composed of two planar arrays one for lband and
one for cband  each array is composed of a uniform grid of dualpolarized
microstrip antenna radiators with each polarization port fed by a separate
corporate feed network  the overall size of the sirc antenna is 120 x 37
meters and consists of three leaves each divided into four subpanels 

model of the sircxsar antenna



	unlike previous sir missions the sirc radar beam is formed from hundreds of
small low power solid state transmitters embedded in the surface of the radar
antenna  by properly phasing the energy from these transmitters the beam can
be electronically steered in the range direction +23deg from the nominal
40deg off nadir position without physically moving the large radar antenna
this feature will enable images to be acquired over a wide range of incidence
angles  

	xsar will provide vv polarization images using a passive slotted waveguide
antenna measuring 120 x 04 meters  other xsar components include a
traveling wave tube as transmitter an exciter receiver and data handling
subsystem  a mechanical  tilt mechanism will point the xsar antenna to angles
between 15 and 60deg in the same direction as the lband and cband beams


	both sirc and xsar can be operated as either stand alone radars or together
roll and yaw maneuvers of the shuttle will allow data to be acquired on either
side of the shuttle nadir ground track  the width of the imaged swath on the
ground varies from 15 to 90 kilometers 9 to 56 miles depending on the
orientation of the antenna beams and the operational mode table 1 presents a
