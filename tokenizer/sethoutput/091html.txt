the tzu chi institute at vgh


acceptance of alternative medicines takes another step towards
the mainstream this autumn when a unique centre opens at the vancouver
general hospital the tzu chi pronounced soochee institute
for complementary and alternative medicine is a partnership between
the tzu chi foundation and vancouver hospital with support from
other area hospitals and postsecondary educational institutions
the worldclass centre will combine research education an informationresource
centre and treatment

interest in alternative health is steadily growing  147all
the documentation tells you that onethird of the population is
using nonconventional methods148 says mike mahony executive
director at the institute but about 80 don146t tell their
regular physicians of their involvement with alternative medicines
he says some patients are afraid of their doctor146s reaction
but mahony urges honesty 147there are now more and more doctors
open to this148 he says 147our goal is to bring together
the conventional and the alternative and the institute146s
logo is representative of the two medicines148 the design
incorporates the traditional serpent and staff of the caduceus
with the chinese yinyang symbol 

not only is the medical profession taking note but a large section
of the population is becoming knowledgeable of the benefits of
alternative approaches to maintaining health 147it applies
in spades here148 mahony notes referring to the cultural
diversity of vancouver a more healthconscious public is demanding
more information and ways of improving their lifestyle  western
medicine takes the approach of fixing a problem if there is something
wrong mahony says whereas holistic medicine looks for the underlying
cause 

the combination of research clinics education and resource centres
makes the institute unique the university of british columbia
and the british columbia institute of technology will be involved
in research and there are also plans to work with the medical
school 147i don146t think there146s anything else as
comprehensive148 says mahony

with the number of partners involved it will not be surprising
if problems arise along the way 147there146s bound to be
some conflict as the two philosophies integrate148 mahony
says 147it146s not going to be smooth sailing all the way148
but with the majority of practitioners looking forward to the
opening mahony says the reception from everyone has been very
positive

a number of alternative fields will be represented through a practitioners146
committee naturopaths chiropractors homeopaths acupuncturists
and hypnotherapists are just a few of the disciplines elaine
stevens a herbalist serving on the committee says she is just
trying to be a voice for the herbal community 

147the idea of the tzu chi is to try to make the best use of
alternative and complementary techniques148 she says 147the
health of the patient is the most important thing we146re looking
at148 even with a common interest and concern for the individual146s
wellbeing steven concedes that it is going to take time to get
everyone on the same page  147as long as everyone works together
this will be a tremendously successful idea148 she says

from a personal perspective stevens says the development of the
institute indicates there is an understanding that a tremendous
amount of work can be done before people need hospitalization
or acute care 147we should be looking at other ways of treating
people148 but she says 147i don146t see this as the
hospital trying to pass or fail various types of treatment148
instead the institute may help set standards and protocols for
everyone involved in health

with the exploding growth of interest in alternative medicines
correct information is necessary in order to achieve the full
benefit of their potential 147one of the biggest dangers is
people selfmedicating148 stevens says 147you don146t
want to be taking things that will work in an adversarial way148
and education shouldn146t be limited to patients either 147if
doctors include herbs in their practice they need greater education
to do so148

as a member of the acupuncture association of british columbia
and the tzu chi practitioners146 committee daniel cheng sees
the institute serving many purposes research can determine the
validity of some of the alternative methods and testing can help
in other ways as well 147this can be more convincing and help
protect the consumers146 rights148 cheng says if some
methods prove successful during testing it may eventually lead
to cheaper health care for everyone as the health of the general
population improves he adds

while there may have been skepticism voiced by the medical community
in the past cheng says he believes that has changed 147in
the beginning they laughed at me148 he says 147the majority
now agree with what we146re trying to do148 he says the
medical field is more openminded now and doctors are trying
their best to help with the program

the institute will require support from other areas to make it
a success 147research is very expensive we will have to see
how this can be done148 he cautions 147we need a lot of
support from the government and the public148 pediatric specialist
dr wah jun tze is the reason for the institute becoming a reality
the blend of eastern and western medicines is possible because
of his efforts and the fact that his conventionalmedicine credentials
are impeccable he was the head of the pediatric endocrinology
division of ubc146s medical school and has been the director
of the metabolic investigation unit at bc children146s hospital
he also received the order of canada in 1994 for his work in promoting
children146s health around the world 

147without him none of this would happen148 mahony says
of tze 147he146s the guy with the vision148
