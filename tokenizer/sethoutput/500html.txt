america online <a
href=httpwwwdbccomcgibinhtxexesquotesource=blqcnetticker=aol>aol already under fire from 17 state attorneys general for the way it has implemented its new pricing is now getting legal heat from at least one of
its own subscribers

an aol subscriber has filed a classaction suit in new york supreme court against the online service claiming that the its policy of automatically switching subscribers from their $995 per month pricing plan to the $1995 plan violates new york state law

the suit filed by stephen dilorenzo a new york resident and aol subscriber represented by bragar  wexler argues that the policy violates states laws against deceptive trade practices the suit asks the court to declare that aol is engaging in deceptive practices under the states law and seeks $7 million in damages
 
the suit comes at a time when aol is negotiating with the attorneys general from 17 states and one territory over the pricing plan

on friday aol resolved the complaints of an 18th statewashingtonwhen it agreed to allow members to pick their pricing plan from an opening splash screen that shows up when users log on

but the agreement apparently did not appease the other attorneys general who are continuing to negotiate with aol nor did it apparently resolve those of
dilorenzo

aols new pricing plan is slated to take effect after december 1 when the members billing cycle begins it will automatically replace the current plan that gives users five hours of service for $995 a month with a flatrate plan that provides unlimited service for $1995 per month under the current plan users pay $295 for each additional hour a pricing scheme that has cost many users a lot more than $1995

many members have applauded aols move to provide unlimited access for $1995 but the way aol has implemented the new prices has come under fire from legal experts and users alike

critics say that aol should have asked users to choose whether they wanted the new plan rather than being switched automatically aol will allow users to retain their current pricing if they go to the new pricing area on aolan area users say is difficult to findand select the current plan but everybody else will start being charged $1995 as of their billing date in december

because of the washington agreement aol users now are presented with a choice to switch to the $1995 plan or choose other options when they log on the new screen will mention the $995 plan on the second screen anyone who doesnt log on in before their december billing date theoretically might not know about the new pricing until they get their next bill

this part where users will be upgraded to the higher priced plan if they happen not to log on is what dilorenzo is characterizing as deceptive marketing

aol would not immediately comment on the suit
