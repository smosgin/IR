		air conditioning feasibility study entech conducted a feasibility study of alternative cooling systems for the mernerpfeiffer hall of science  cooling systems evaluated consisted of direct expansion units airsource heat pumps watersource 
heat pumps chilled water and thermal storage water andor ice  all systems were evaluated for construction costs comfort energy consumption operating and maintenance costs and expected useful life  feasibility study completed november 1992
		
		mohn hall entech conducted an energy audit for mohn hall dormitory  the energy evaluation covered all energy systems inculding outside lighting  entech identified four energy conservation opportunities ecos


efficient fluorescent lighting
incandescent to fluorescent lighting
power factor correction
replace electric rooftop units with new gas rooftop hvac unit


the estimated construction cost for the four ecos was approximately $9200  the estimated annual savings were $3200 for a 14 reduction from current energy expenditures resulting in a simple payback period of 28 years

entech also completed and submitted an energy conservation measure ecm grant application to the pennsylvania energy office for cycle xvi funding for the four 4 ecos if accepted the grant would pay 50 of the engineering and construction costs involv
ed up to a maximum amount of $75000
