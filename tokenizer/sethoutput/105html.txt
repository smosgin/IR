ive found you but youve been beaten battered starved
malnourished neglected 

discounted and disowned i must restore you to health so we
can have our adventures 
by julia cameron

reviewed by samaya ryane


what words might you find on julia camerons tshirt as she walks
her dogs in the pi~non foothills of new mexico or travels on
the road during her 18city author tour this fall always in process
author of the artists way a spiritual path to higher creativity
she has come out with another bright lively personal jewel that
encourages readers to keep creating the vein of gold a journey
to your creative heart recently released shares a similar spirit
with its ancestor the artists waycreativity is never over
and the author is constantly creatingin process her personal
stories useful exercises and lively upbeat writing manner cajole
and entice your childselfthe creatorto come out to play

the artists way published four years ago spent 26 weeks on
the publishers weekly bestseller list in 1995 alone and has
sold more than 650000 copies it has inspired hundreds of thousands
of people to pursue their creative dreams through the comprehensive
12week program

according to cameron quotthe artists way was a book of reunion
and discovery ahhah i do have inside me an artist an inner
youngster who had been lost to me    the vein of gold is
a book of healing and rehabilitation ive found you but youve
been beaten battered starved malnourished neglected discounted
and disowned i must restore you to health so we can have our
adventuresquot

both books are according to cameron quotthe distillate of
30 years of artistic practicequot it is my belief and my experience
as a teacher that all of us are healthy enough to practise creativity
it is not a dangerous endeavour requiring trained facilitators
it is our human birthright and something we can do gently and
collectively creativity is like breathing pointers might help
but we do the process ourselves

after the vein of golds initial chapter entitled setting out
which brings you up to date on the tools of the artists way
there are seven chapters of essays that house over 100 creative
tasks which take us through the various kingdoms as a journey
to the heart of creativity the following are two of the seven
kingdoms cameron describes included is a task and one of the
513 quotes of other artists she has placed in the margins
the kingdom of story 


divide a piece of notebook paper into three parts horizontally
label the top third years 15 the middle is years 510
the bottom third is years 1015 on additional pieces of paper
move through your life in fiveyear increments up to your current
age jotting down notes in answer to these questions

where did you live who were your major players any significant
pets what were your favourite foods games music friend toys
hobbies interests and clothes what were your major events what
are your dominant memories

the challenge then is to be the creative mythmaker that we
are to consciously choose our myth lest it be chosen for us
by the collective mind

mary elizabeth marlow
the kingdom of sight


task time capsule collage from whatever sourcemagazines newspapers
catalogs cereal boxes old photo collections collect and save
20 images that in some way resonate with your memories associations
and life experiences from years one to five

dont be too literal with yourself if your dominant memory of
your toddlers bedroom is the great green leafy tree outside the
window you can use a picture of the rain forest or even a salad
if that green works for you in conjuring up the association remember
you are both the i and the eye in this exercise it is not
necessary to know why an image speaks to you the fact that it
does is connection enough

take about 20 minutes and swiftly lay the images down on poster
board i prefer working with oldfashioned elmers glue although
there are those who swear by glue sticks feel free to add words
or glitter to outline with magic marker or dabble with paints
this is your collage and it is meant to reflect your childself
try to let yourself go back to that child and remember you
may want to set aside time each day for a week to move another
five years further with your time capsule collage you may also
want to hang these collages for a while a hallway hung with a
row of them becomes a visual narrative time line not unlike a
home movie

the local painters were my idolsthese artists too were grownups
but they were grownups who could still see their eye was still
in love like minequot
