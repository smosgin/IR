our blood vessels are not the only ones that clog with age buildings suffer a similar fate as well buildings fall sick when their airducts become choked with accumulated dirt and dust

sick buildings
essentially sick buildings are modern central airconditioned buildings that were designed and built to save energy and costs but with little consideration for the respiratory wellbeing of the inhabitants buildings become sick when the air becomes stale because of excessive dust bacteria and gases

the us environment protection agency epa consistently ranks poor indoor air quality iaq as a major health concern in their studies

hidden from our eyes sealed dusts such as dirty heating ventilation and airconditioning systems are the major causes of poor indoor air quality dirty ventilation systems are also perfect breeding grounds for microorganisms such as bacteria and fungus

sick building syndrome

sick building syndrome sbs a disease not widely known is a pervasive ailment caused by poor iaq in airconditioned environment sbs has been accorded high priority by the world health organisation who in view of the large numbers of people potentially at risk sbs is characterised by eyes nose and throat irritation mental fatique headaches and body aches

surveys have suggested that this syndrome is a major cause of absenteeism and reduced working efficiency among office workers resulting in lost man hours similarly an iaq survey conducted in six airconditioned buildings in singapore between november 1992 and july 1993 revealed higher incidences of mental and physical stress among workers

a recent study of the air quality of 57 commercial offices conducted by nus found that half the number of offices had unacceptable formaldehyde levels formaldehyde is a cancer causing agent found in furniture glue 60 of the building studied also had unhealthy carbon dioxide levels

maintaining air quality in a sealed environment is an important but often overlooked issue this is compounded by the fact that most airducts are difficult and expensive to clean

but now the impossible is made easy with advanced technology
