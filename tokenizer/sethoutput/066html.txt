the power of blessing
by wayne powell
long before the rise of atlantis the legend goes a race of
men came to our solar system from a group of stars now known as
the pleiades they called themselves the people of mu but were
also known as manahuna or menehune151the 145people of secret
power146151because of their advanced technology and psychic
powers they were a small pygmylike people with their own unique
philosophy for successful living once firmly established on earth
they began to extend their knowledge to mankind so that it would
survive throughout time their language was polynesian traces
of which are still found all over the world today and their knowledge
was huna 

huna is a philosophy of life that is at the root of all ancient
cultures and spiritual paths free of dogma it is simply the
145secret science behind miracles146 or the hidden knowledge
deep within our souls of who we are and how our lives can really
work  within the huna philosophy there are seven spiritual principles
of life which explain the way the world works these principles
which are universal and allencompassing go beyond our perceptions
of reality with a meaning much deeper than meets the eye the
seven principles of huna meaning secret or hidden knowledge
are refreshingly simple and can serve as meditations or chants
for enhancing everyday life

ike151the world is what you think it is
kala151there are no limits
makia151energy flows where attention goes 
manawa151now is the moment of power
aloha151to love is to be happy with
mana151all power comes from within
pono151effectiveness is the measure of truth




how these principles can be applied to everyday life


1 ike the world is what you think it is when we criticize
another we are implying that heshe is not acting in accordance
with our personal framework of reality however  everyone has
their own individual perception of what reality is according
to their own beliefs and assumptions about life our personal
view is only what146s true for us yet we tend to invalidate
what we do not understand if we truly love another then we strive
to understand their point of view it is every bit as valid to
them as ours is to us and provides the balancing polarity to
our point of view according to the principle of ike you must
bless another146s contrasting viewpoint if you want yours to
be accepted or blessed in return

2 kala in a world of no limits we can have allencompassing
unity of all things and all beings we are intimately connected
to each other and to everything in existence every thought produces
an effect at some level therefore when we criticize someone
we are asking to be criticized but when you find yourself hating
another for the way they act towards you  you may find151if
you look closely at yourself151that you too are guilty of acting
the same way

the beauty of this principle is that when you bless another
you are blessing yourself as well and you will be blessed by
others when you bless anything you are being blessed we are
truly one being sharing one mind and growing through all matter
and many faces this concept of oneness explains why telepathy
works and why the collective thought forms of the masses create
our reality here on earth

3 makia if energy flows where our attention goes and we
get what we focus on then it is wise to look closely at the object
of our focus if we pay close attention to what we don146t
like about an individual then it grows in our awareness and experience
with them by focusing on the good in them we can experience
and bless that instead according to this third principle you
are where your attention is because you are your attention a
great master from india once said 147if your attention is
diffused then you are diffused if your attention is in the past
then you are in the past if your attention is in the present
moment then you are in god and god is in you148

4 manawa the third principle leads into the fourth according
to which now is the moment of power how many of us live in the
moment and appreciate its beauty and grace when we can approach
each moment without judgement it reveals itself as a holy instant
waiting to be born into our awareness every moment is a miracle
of life propelled forth by the previous moment if you trace your
thoughts back in time you will find that your current situations
and relationships are truly designed by your thinking only decisions
that you make right now can have any effect on your future

5 aloha to love is to be happy with in huna this idea
encompasses the power of blessing and the practice of acceptance
the more you can actualize nonjudgement in your life the more
love will flow through your life by making this a daily practice
in your life and by blessing everyone and everything that symbolizes
what you want you can powerfully fulfill your desires 





love is the greatest power that we know the more we share
this power the more we become attuned to its divine nature151what
the hawaiians call aloha the loving use of this limitless energy
is the key to having everything that146s worth having in this
world  this simple concept is one of the most valuable things
we can learn on earth however it is not necessarily easy to
put into practice who can claim that they are always accepting
and tolerant of others without judgement
we can begin to apply this principle by witnessing the automatic
patterns of our ku the huna term for subconscious mind and
catching ourselves whenever we are not unconditionally loving
when we can admire instead of criticizing affirm instead of
doubting appreciate instead of blaming and trust instead of
worrying then we can say we have learned something about loving
and only then will we feel the awesome and limitless power of
our life146s blessings
bless the beauty in all people and in the nature around you151the
mountains the trees the sun the moon the sea the smiles
the laughter the cry of a seagull the love of a mother the
innocence of a child the companionship of a friend and the inspiration
of a teacher bless the food you eat and the health of yourself
and family  bless constantly and be thankful for everyone and
everything in your life and you will feel more joy and happiness
than you could ever have imagined everything is alive aware
and responsive so in blessing everything you will be blessed
by everything
the hawaiian kahunas used ha or the breath of life as a
main tool for healing and blessing rituals  this is great way
to channel more spirit energy through your being long ago the
term given to the missionaries by the hawaiians was ha146ole
meaning 145without breath146 the hawaiian kahunas and priests
couldn146t understand how anyone could perform sacred rituals
without pumping mana with their breathing to boost the life force
this is a form of breathing called pico pico which greatly expands
the aura or energy field it involves focusing your attention
on the crown of your head as you breathe in deeply and on your
navel as you exhale fully  in practising this breath we are
reminded of the earlier principles 145energy flows where attention
goes146 and 145there are no limits146 to how connected
you can be to everyone and all that is

6 mana the sixth principle 147all power comes from within148
reminds us that things only have power over us to the degree that
we give them power we sometimes give our power away by letting
others make decisions for us but in fact we are in all ways
the source
when we focus on something we don146t like we give it
the power to make us unhappy and the more we think about it
the more power we give it in our reality151since everything
is alive aware and responsive to our attention unless we approach
life146s challenges with confidence and see them as a means
of refining our skills as a peacemaker and loving human being
we give our power away if our purpose for living here on earth
is to find out who we are and why we are here then we need to
remember that we are the source if we acknowledge this then
everyone you encounter will feel the source in you just as you
will feel the source in them claim your power own it and be
the source
the following exercise can help you connect your mana or
life force with your aumakua higher self
sit comfortably and close your eyes for at least one full
minute as you do some pico pico breathing while you breathe deeply
think of something really beautiful  see it clearly in your mind146s
eye and hold it there see all the details of its beauty151colour
size shape smell sound texture etc as you hold this image
of great beauty in your mind and begin to bless it with your breathing
your energy field will change when you finish this meditation
you will feel quite peaceful bless and be thankful for this connection
with your aumakua it is easy to connect with god because his
light shines in all people and in all things this energy of alohamana
or loving power is what binds this whole universe together we
only have to turn our attention inwards to find an unlimited abundance
of it hidden in our souls all power comes from within

7 pono the seventh and last principle effectiveness is the
measure of truth begs for a closer look at what is or isn146t
working for you in your life if something is not giving the results
you want then change your approach  the corollary to this idea
is that there is always another way to do anything



as human beings we have great creative abilities to explore
different approaches to our problems however we often become
fixated on getting something a certain way or through a certain
person within a certain time frame we can be stubborn and try
to kill the relationship in order to get our way or we can take
a deep breath and back off often when we force something it breaks
learning to 145let go and let god146 is a very powerful
way to get help from your higher source  if you truly surrender
to that source within yourself remembering that all power comes
from within you will find a new idea person or approach a synchronicity
will take place once the universe has had time to align your prayerful
request in giving up your frustration and allowing the miracle
of life to take over you will experience a release of great pressure
knowing that your problem is being processed at a higher level
now more energy can flow into other areas of your life that need
attention

chanting the seven principles in hawaiian will generate a
very powerful frequency that will change any mood or situation
and connect you with your inner source the consonants are pronounced
as in english and the vowels as in spanish a as in father e
as in prey i as in pita o as in mote and u as in duty ike
kala makia manawa aloha mana pono
the following is a good blessing chant you can use to empower
yourself each threeword phrase represents one of the seven principles
i am aware i am free i am focused i am here i am loved
i am strong i am healed
blessing seems like such a simple thing but its awesome power
should not be underestimated  a kahuna once said 147it146s
so easy to overlook the most simple perfection in all things
in search of the complexity of truth148

may you always be blessed
