on 3 april 1995 a low earthorbiting leo receiver was
successfully launched aboard the microlab 1 satellite  this
receiver orbiting at an altitude of about 700 km receives radio
signals from the constellation of 24 global positioning system
gps satellites  these radio signals are refracted or bent by the
earths atmosphere and by measuring the doppler shifted
frequency of the received radio signals these measurements are
converted into vertical pressure and temperature profiles of the
earths atmosphere  early results indicate that accuracies of about
1 to 2 k are being obtained between altitudes of about 5 km to
35 km  this new remote sensing technique promises to open up
new ways to monitor climate and climate change and also to
provide substantially improved initial global data for weather
prediction

the project is a joint program between the university corporation
for atmospheric research ucar the national center for
atmospheric research ncar the jet propulsion laboratory
jpl orbital sciences corporation osc allan osborne
associates and the university of arizona  the figure shows a
typical gpsmet vertical temperature profile together with nearby
