new cpj report finds record 182 journalists imprisoned worldwide
for second consecutive year turkey is biggest offender with 51 jailed journalists 
ethiopia 31 china 20 and kuwait 18 also top list of 22 countries  

washington dca record 182 journalists were in prison in 22 countries at the end 
of 1995 the committee to protect journalists reported today in attacks on the press in 1995 its annual booklength survey of press freedom violations around the world 

for the second consecutive year turkey held more journalists in jail 51 than any 
other country as the government continued to suppress independent reporting on the 
kurdish conflict the committee to protect journalists today called on prime minister 
mesut yilmaz to release turkeys imprisoned journalists and rescind the laws used to 
punish and censor the local press 

turkey surpasses such totalitarian regimes as china and syria in its willingness 
to throw journalists in jail said cpj chair kati marton the new turkish government 
should demonstrate its commitment to democracy by releasing our imprisoned colleagues 
and abolishing article 8 of the antiterror law and article 312 of the penal code 
which are inherently incompatible with press freedom

the number of confirmed cases of imprisoned journalists in 1995 exceeds cpjs accounting 
for 1994 a thenrecord 173 imprisoned journalists at years end the increase in 
1995 was largely attributable to the recent crackdown on independent journalism in 
ethiopia and nigeria in each of the 182 cases documented in attacks on the press in 1995 cpj staff researchers verified that the jailed journalists were imprisoned as a 
direct reprisal for their reporting and remained incarcerated on dec 31 1995 

imprisonment is a very effective form of censorship said william a orme jr 
cpjs executive director

attacks on the press in 1995
 documents that at years end

 at least 182 journalists were in jail up from 173 in 1994
 the four countries with the highest number of imprisoned journalists were turkey 
51 ethiopia 31 china 20 and kuwait 18
 vietnam peru myanmar burma and nigeria each held eight journalists in jail 
and
 there were six jailed journalists in syria four in indonesia and algeria and three 
in zaire


the legal tools used to imprisonnbspjournalists 
though the political contexts of these imprisonments vary widely from country to country 
the incarcerations of journalists fall into several broad categories some representative 
cases 

turkey 
isik ocak yurtcu the editor of ozgur gundem turkeys leading prokurdish daily was imprisoned on dec 28 1994 charged under 
article 8 of the antiterror law he was convicted of publishing separatist propaganda 
he remains in prison serving a 25year sentence article 8 of the antiterror 
law defines nongovernmental accounts of the kurdish conflict as proscribed propaganda 
publishing such independent reports is a criminal offense 

turkey is the biggest offender in this category but it is not unique in ethiopia 
and many other countries journalists writing or broadcasting reports on civil war 
or ethnic strife are accused of violating broadly drafted hate speech laws as if 
their reporting were the cause rather than a consequence of those conflicts

peru
eduardo sihue cano a graphic artist for the leftwing magazine cambio was imprisoned 
on june 12 1992 and sentenced to six years in prison for being an apologist for 
terrorism a crime under perus 1992 antiterrorism legislation under peruvian 
antiterror laws sihue had no right to confront his accuser his attorney could not 
review evidence beforehand or otherwise challenge the governments case the judges 
were hooded faceless security officials with limited legal training sihue remains 
in prison

again peru is not unique turkey kuwait algeria china iran myanmar burma nigeria 
syria tunisia and vietnam also consider the publication of news stories about armed 
insurgents a criminal violation of antiterrorism laws special tribunals with unidentified accusers and anonymous judges are used by several other countries including 
the united kingdom for prosecuting alleged terrorist offenses

ivory coast cote divoire 
abou drahamane sangare and emmanuel kore who work for the opposition daily la voie were imprisoned on dec 21 1995 for suggesting in print that president henri konan 
bedies attendance at the african champions cup final brought bad luck to the losing 
national soccer team the two were sentenced to two years in prison for offending 
the chief of state they remain in prison

turkey indonesia central african republic iran myanmar burma and cameroon and 
many other countries use criminal libel and slander laws to imprison reporters who 
write unflattering stories about the president elected officials spiritual leaders 
and businessmen


china
 gao yu a freelance journalist from hong kong was imprisoned on oct 2 1993 
she was tried without counsel and sentenced to six years in prison for leaking state 
secrets about chinas structural reforms in articles for the probeijing hong kong 
magazine mirror monthly
she remains in prison

algeria vietnam and others rely on similarly arbitrary and vague definitions of national 
security and state secrets to imprison journalists

nigeria
nosa igiebor the editor in chief of nigerias tell
 magazine was imprisoned on dec 23 1995 he was arrested by six members of the 
state security service at his home in lagos authorities demanded that he reveal 
his sources for articles critical of the government and accused him of receiving 
financial support from outsiders igiebors arrest and detention were confirmed by numerous 
cpj sources in nigeria government authorities still deny that they have detained 
him however he has not been charged with any crime

in algeria iraq libya western sahara zaire zambia and other countries journalists 
are often jailed without charges authorities also often deny that they are holding 
these journalists in jail which makes it difficult to confirm many cases of imprisoned journalists 

turkish campaign against press ensnares american journalist
almost all of the journalists prosecuted for these offenses are nationals working 
for local publications and broadcast outlets one recent exception was aliza marcus 
an american journalist working in reuters istanbul bureau who was charged in august 
1995 for allegedly contravening article 312 of the penal code which makes it a crime 
to incite racial hatred marcus real offense was reporting on the forced evacuation 
of kurdish villages by the military she faced up to three years in prison even 
though the facts in her story were never contested the charges against marcus were dropped 
after her trial prompted protests from prominent foreign journalists including cpj 
honorary chairman walter cronkite who discussed the case in ankara with thenprime minister tansu ciller 

i believe international pressure made a big difference in my case but turkish journalists 
dont get the same level of international support said marcus who is receiving 
a freedom of the press award from the national press club in washington today marcus has since left turkey forced out by the governments refusal to renew her press 
accreditation she now works for reuters in cyprus
