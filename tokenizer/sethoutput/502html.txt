most computer users do not consider the online world a replacement for other sources of entertainment according to a survey from <a
href=httpwwwintelliquestcom>intelliquests worldwide
internetonline tracking service in which just 17 percent of respondents described cyberspace quotalwaysquot or quotusuallyquot better than than
television

conducted in april and may the study covers the home and business use of people 16 and older in the us some of the conclusions are as follows

fiftyfour percent of the 16andover population use a computer including at home work or school of computer users 32 percent ventured online in the three months prior to being interviewed which projects to 35 million user of the internet or online services

nearly half of those who go online about 15 million said they are connected no more than 2 hours per week of the remaining 20 million users about 8 million access from home and are online more than 5 hours per week an important statistic for those looking to exploit the internet
as a home entertainment medium
 
the survey drew no comparisons between the internet and printed
entertainment although 61 percent described themselves as quotavidquot readers of books

the survey also confirmed some of the conventional wisdom concerning the net 64 percent of users are male 46 percent are collegeeducated and 60 percent have household incomes over $50000

putting the numbers against a larger backdrop the survey found that 35
percent of all fulltime us students 16 and over are online compared with
only 4 percent of unemployed or retired people only 14 percent of all
smallbusiness employees use online services

webmasters might be interested to know that 26 percent of users quotalwaysquot use a search engine and 13 percent quotalwaysquot use bookmarks although 44 percent quotneverquot use them most likely the same people who refuse to use a map or read instruction manuals

other findings included 75 percent used email in the month before their interview 69 percent accessed the web 52 percent went online to obtain general news 49 percent sought out information about quotspecific products and servicesquot 32 percent read an online magazine 31 percent downloaded shareware or freeware and 7 percent attempted an online banking transaction the same number that accessed adult entertainment
