 the tzu chi institute at vgh 
acceptance of alternative medicines takes another step towards
the mainstream this autumn when a unique centre opens at the vancouver
general hospital. the tzu chi (pronounced soo-chee) institute
for complementary and alternative medicine is a partnership between
the tzu chi foundation and vancouver hospital, with support from
other area hospitals and post-secondary educational institutions.
the world-class centre will combine research, education, an information/resource
centre and treatment.
interest in alternative health is steadily growing.  &#147;all
the documentation tells you that one-third of the population is
using non-conventional methods,&#148; says mike mahony, executive
director at the institute. but about 80% don&#146;t tell their
regular physicians of their involvement with alternative medicines,
he says. some patients are afraid of their doctor&#146;s reaction,
but mahony urges honesty. &#147;there are now more and more doctors
open to this,&#148; he says. &#147;our goal is to bring together
the conventional and the alternative, and the [institute&#146;s]
logo is representative of the two medicines.&#148; the design
incorporates the traditional serpent and staff of the caduceus
with the chinese yin/yang symbol. 
not only is the medical profession taking note, but a large section
of the population is becoming knowledgeable of the benefits of
alternative approaches to maintaining health. &#147;it applies
in spades here,&#148; mahony notes, referring to the cultural
diversity of vancouver. a more health-conscious public is demanding
more information and ways of improving their lifestyle.  western
medicine takes the approach of fixing a problem if there is something
wrong, mahony says, whereas holistic medicine looks for the underlying
cause. 
the combination of research, clinics, education and resource centres
makes the institute unique. the university of british columbia
and the british columbia institute of technology will be involved
in research, and there are also plans to work with the medical
school. &#147;i don&#146;t think there&#146;s anything else as
comprehensive,&#148; says mahony.
with the number of partners involved, it will not be surprising
if problems arise along the way. &#147;there&#146;s bound to be
some conflict as the two [philosophies] integrate,&#148; mahony
says. &#147;it&#146;s not going to be smooth sailing all the way.&#148;
but with the majority of practitioners looking forward to the
opening, mahony says the reception from everyone has been very
positive.
a number of alternative fields will be represented through a practitioners&#146;
committee. naturopaths, chiropractors, homeopaths, acupuncturists,
and hypnotherapists are just a few of the disciplines. elaine
stevens, a herbalist serving on the committee, says she is just
trying to be a voice for the herbal community. 
&#147;the idea of the tzu chi is to try to make the best use of
alternative and complementary techniques,&#148; she says. &#147;the
health of the patient is the most important thing we&#146;re looking
at.&#148; even with a common interest and concern for the individual&#146;s
well-being, steven concedes that it is going to take time to get
everyone on the same page.  &#147;as long as everyone works together
this will be a tremendously successful idea,&#148; she says.
from a personal perspective, stevens says the development of the
institute indicates there is an understanding that a tremendous
amount of work can be done before people need hospitalization
or acute care. &#147;we should be looking at other ways of treating
people.&#148; but, she says, &#147;i don&#146;t see this as the
hospital trying to pass or fail various types of treatment.&#148;
instead, the institute may help set standards and protocols for
everyone involved in health.
with the exploding growth of interest in alternative medicines,
correct information is necessary in order to achieve the full
benefit of their potential. &#147;one of the biggest dangers is
people self-medicating,&#148; stevens says. &#147;you don&#146;t
want to be taking things that will work in an adversarial way.&#148;
and education shouldn&#146;t be limited to patients, either. &#147;if
doctors include herbs in their practice, they need greater education
to do so.&#148;
as a member of the acupuncture association of british columbia
and the tzu chi practitioners&#146; committee, daniel cheng sees
the institute serving many purposes. research can determine the
validity of some of the alternative methods, and testing can help
in other ways as well. &#147;this can be more convincing and help
protect the consumers&#146; rights,&#148; cheng says. if some
methods prove successful during testing, it may eventually lead
to cheaper health care for everyone as the health of the general
population improves, he adds.
while there may have been skepticism voiced by the medical community
in the past, cheng says he believes that has changed. &#147;in
the beginning, they laughed at me,&#148; he says. &#147;the majority
now agree with what we&#146;re trying to do.&#148; he says the
medical field is more open-minded now, and doctors are trying
their best to help with the program.
the institute will require support from other areas to make it
a success. &#147;research is very expensive; we will have to see
how this can be done,&#148; he cautions. &#147;we need a lot of
support from the government and the public.&#148; pediatric specialist
dr wah jun tze is the reason for the institute becoming a reality.
the blend of eastern and western medicines is possible because
of his efforts and the fact that his conventional-medicine credentials
are impeccable. he was the head of the pediatric endocrinology
division of ubc&#146;s medical school, and has been the director
of the metabolic investigation unit at bc children&#146;s hospital.
he also received the order of canada in 1994 for his work in promoting
children&#146;s health around the world. 
&#147;without him, none of this would happen,&#148; mahony says
of tze. &#147;he&#146;s the guy with the vision.&#148;
