keep car cool  
summer heat is hard on a car's interior.  it can cause the headliner (ceiling
fabric) to droop, the padded dash to crack and upholstery to fade. 
many summer related problems can be addressed with a little common sense.  try
to park in the shade.  avoid those wide open spaces that allow relentless full
time exposure to the sun. 
try to park near a building to assure your car of some shade at least part of
the time. 
finally, purchase a sun shade.  these inexpensive cardboard blockers placed in
the windshield and rear windows help lower the interior temperature. 
more tips on protecting your car's interior are in a free pamphlet, `how to
keep your car looking young', published by the car care council.  send a
stamped, self addressed envelope to the car care council, dept. n, one grande
lake drive, port clinton, oh  43452.
