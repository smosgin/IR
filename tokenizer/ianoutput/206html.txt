  roelof t. bruintjes: ph. d. 
  affiliate professor 
 research interests:  cloud physics, mesoscale modeling, and weather 
modifications  
dr. bruintjes works on the improvement of microphysical parameterization in 
numerical cloud- and mesoscale models, evaluating cloud seeding efforts with 
numerical models, on the development of new cloud seeding techniques, and 
developing linked atmospheric/hydrological models to simulate the full 
hydrological cycle.
