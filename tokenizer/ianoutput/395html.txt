    bar associations      
bar associations are professional groups for attorneys. bar associations view helping the public as an important part of their mission. the largest bar association in illinois is the illinois state bar association (isba). each member of the isba may also belong to one of the 11 local bar associations. these associations serve their members by providing continuing legal education and a forum for discussing concerns of the legal profession. they also serve the public, providing lawyer referrals, informational booklets and pamphlets, telephone information services, and a variety of public education programs. most of these services are available at little or no cost.  
members of the public should consider taking advantage of bar association services when they are seeking general information. although they cannot provide legal advice, bar associations can help people decide whether to pursue a case, what actions to take, and what type of lawyer to contact. a list of bar associations and bar association referral services appear later in this appendix.  
the following pamphlets were prepared and published by the illinois state bar association as a public service. their purpose is to inform citizens of their legal rights and obligations. consult your lawyer if you have questions about application of the law in a particular case. 
single copies of each of the pamphlets are free to individuals. spanish language translations are also available. for information on obtaining quantity copies, write or call the isba at the following:

as lawyers have grown increasingly concerned about their public image, they have also expanded their efforts to reach out to the public and provide helpful services to consumers. free information, referrals, and a variety of educational programs are only a telephone call away. consumers seeking information would be wise to make that call as one of their first steps in pursuing a legal matter.
