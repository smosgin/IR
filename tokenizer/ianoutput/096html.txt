 project status report 
     mission status report for the period between
     day 10: o hrs and day 11 0 hrs mission elapsed time
     summary-operations continued very smoothly. the decision was made
to
     continue interferometry data takes, but to allow the orbit to
slowly
     begin drifting to develop a data set with a large variety of
     baselines. tests were run to help develop confidence in the
recorded
     now occupying the position of phrr 1. the spare recorder and power
    supply had been put into this position to replace the original
     recorder in this position. it was determined that the spare was
     recording properly, but had a cross speed playback tracking
problem.
     the tapes being recorded were good.
     the sir-c electronics were switched to the backup units to
     evaluate their health as an engineering check.
     36 tapes of x-sar data were recorded  and 163 sir-c tapes were
     recorded.
     sir-c and x-sar were shut down at 18:30 hrs met and 12:00 hrs
     met.  the crew began their descent and landing preparations which
     include stowing the ku band communications antenna, closing the
cargo
     bay doors and stowing cameras, film, and other items.
     at the time of this report it is still unclear whether the
     landing will take place at the kennedy space center or the dryden
     facility. weather is expected to be marginal at kennedy.
     the final science press briefing was held.. the emphasis  was  on
     the interferometry results, which include detection of  change
between
     the april and october flights in the long valley caldera in
california
     and  the kiluaea area. in hawaii. the kiluaea changes were on the
     order of 10 cm and appear to be substantiated by independent gps
     measurements.
     anomalies- none
