 summer salads 
what can be more appetizing on a hot summer&#146;s day than a
plateful of crisp, colourful vegetables.  salads offer a great
way of incorporating essential omega 3 fatty acids by using cold-pressed
oils such as flax, canola, soybean or walnut in dressings. when
used as  main dishes, they can also include a light source of
protein, such as sprouted beans, or nuts and seeds.
 selecting vegetable oils for salads 
extra virgin olive oil: the full-bodied, first press without chemicals
or heat is the best. all  other types are poorer quality and can
be lighter in flavour. contains natural beta sistosterol, vitamin
e, and other anti-oxidants. does not need refrigeration. found
in supermarkets or natural food stores.
flax oil: a great source of essential omega 3 fatty acids for
vegans or others who don&#146;t eat fish. available in natural
food stores, the best and richest form is cold pressed. the container
should be dark to minimize light peroxidation. look for the expiry
date and always refrigerate, or freeze for longer periods. cold-pressed
oils should not be heated excessively, and are best used with
salads, and on cooked vegetables or grains.  the wonderful flax
oil dressing included here goes particularly well with green salads
composed of young greens such as mustard greens, kale, dutch endive,
french sorrel and watercress&#151;sliced match-stick thin.
 basic flax oil and vinegar dressing
 the flax oil in this recipe gives a nutty flavour. add a little
mayonnaise for a dip.
 &#189; cup flax oil
 3 tbsp lemon juice, rice or cider vinegar
 3 tbsp water
 2 to 3 medium cloves garlic
 &#189; tsp sweetener (maple syrup, honey)
 1 tsp dijon mustard

 1 tsp light miso
 1 tsp tamari soy sauce
 &#189; tsp ground cumin or curry powder
place ingredients in blender. puree until smooth. cover and refrigerate
for up to one week. makes about &#190; cup. olive or canola oil
can be substituted for the flax oil. to make a herb dressing,
add 2 tbsp chopped fresh or 1 tsp dried herbs.

 earthsave news &amp; views 
the dairy industry has bought a large soy milk company&#151;
pacific soy&#151;which is currently producing soy milk for other
soy industries. they have asked the canadian government to allow
this soy milk to be fortified with b12, zinc, calcium and
vitamin d. with this industry  supporting such a request, we are
likely to see fortified products on the market by the autumn.
this manoeuvre will provide more opportunity for vegans, or those
who choose not to use cow&#146;s milk, to conveniently obtain
adequate amounts of these nutrients.
