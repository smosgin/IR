our company owns a mitsubishi industrial micro-robot model rv-m2. i have encountered problem of c program  interface with the robot via rs 232 serial port. the c function format used to send to the robot is    fputs("string of robot commands",stdaux); but always received no respond from the robot, can anyone up in  the cyber space tell me why? thanks, regards.
