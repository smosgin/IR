certain times each month are poor times to make major decisions or purchases.  these are the times when your purchases turn out to be something you never wear or use.  they are also disastrous times to hold important meetings!
when the moon is �void of course,� we become like floating balloons of helium, and can�t trust our decision-making skills because we are not grounded. whatever we initiate during these times tends not to fulfill its purpose.
keep an eye on the times listed in this column. 
 during these times : 
 don�t begin anything important;
 don�t make major purchases;
 don�t make important plans;
 expect shortages, delays and goof-ups.
