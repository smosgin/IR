 tesla was right! 
 the coming free energy revolution 
 by joseph duggan 
&#147;ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven
by a power obtainable at any point in the universe... throughout
space there is abundant energy.&#148;
&#151;nicola tesla 1857-1943
jeane manning, canadian author of the coming energy revolution&#151;the
search for free energy,  strongly agrees with nicola tesla&#146;s
prediction and in fact envisions that production models of free
energy devices are &#147;just around the corner.&#148;  on the
cover of her new book, manning states, &#147;there is a new and
exciting revolution coming. it will dramatically change our landscape,
our environment, our economy, and our lives. it will provide each
and every one of us with a truly unique sense of independence.
it will mark the end of oil-influenced politics, and the beginning
of a bright new millennium&#151;a time in which we will all have
our own unlimited sources of non-polluting energy which will power
our vehicles, heat our homes and light up our lives. however,
it will not come without a struggle, as history has already shown.&#148;
jeane manning is a freelance journalist who, since 1981, has traveled
throughout north america and europe to both study and report on
new-energy technologies. her articles and essays have appeared
in numerous energy journals as well as several books. she has
worked as a newspaper reporter and editor, raised three children,
and now resides in vancouver, bc. what made her step off a safe
career ladder ten years ago and into the uncertainty of researching
the non-conventional &#145;free energy&#146; movement? 
&#147;i was living in vernon, bc, and heard about an inventor
in penticton who invented an extraordinary magnetic dynamo. he
named his company pran tech, because he believed that powerful
magnets somehow suck in the &#145;prana&#146;&#151;a subtle energy
recognized by the ancients&#151;from the air around us. using
a super-efficient arrangement of permanent magnets and electrical
coils, he claimed the machine when fully developed would put out
more electricity than it took to run it. 
&#147;i didn&#146;t understand the technical explanations at the
time, but i was convinced that he sincerely wanted to help clean
up the planet with a pollution-free energy source. i thought,
&#145;if this is real, we won&#146;t need to dam any more wild
rivers or poison the air.  if it is bona fide, then as a journalist
i want to spread the word about it when the time is right.&#148;
fifteen years later, the time was right.
the coming energy revolution,  published in 1996, covers the history
of free energy research, explains the conceptual basis of this
new technology and introduces us to some of the inventors, their
struggles, failures, and successes. manning&#146;s research has
placed her in the middle of an international subculture that is&#151;excuse
the pun&#151;electric with excitement over recent developments
in non-conventional energy alternatives. 
the scene is no longer filled with garage inventors and &#145;mad
scientists;&#146; instead, a small but increasing number of serious
researchers with phds in physics or engineering is convinced that
mainstream science texts will have to be rewritten. some of these
people publish articles in respected physics journals, explaining
that the &#147;zero-point quantum fluctuations of the vacuum of
space&#148; could be cohered into a usable energy source.   
free energy is a misnomer, manning points out, because there is
a cost associated with building machines to generate electrical
energy, even if the non-conventional machines need no fuel to
operate.  however, the phrase caught the imagination of many people
over the years, and is now used in some circles as a slogan with
&#145;free&#146; as a verb&#151; &#147;let&#146;s free energy!&#148;
today&#146;s energy researchers, such as hal fox, phd, of salt
lake city, prefer terms such as &#145;space energy&#146; to describe
the incredible amounts of power available in the so-called vacuum
of space around us.  (respected theorists say there is enough
potential energy in the vacuum in a light bulb to boil all the
world&#146;s oceans if it could be put to use. new-energy theorists
want to use only a trickle of that energy, to give the world a
clean source of power.)  
as with the personal computer revolution 20 years ago, inventors
are making breakthroughs in home workshops and garages as well
as private laboratories. observers of the science underground
predict that this revolution will have even more of an impact
on society than pcs have had. it could do more than transform
our homes, vehicles, and factories; it will also provide a means
to clean up rivers as well as the air and soils.
scrutiny of the emerging energy field reveals a complex picture,
with dark areas of greed, corporate lobbying, international energy
politics, bureaucratic inertia, academic resistance, secrecy,
and inventors&#146; paranoia.  &#147;however, the bright spots
of irrepressible new discoveries are growing increasingly faster
and are showing up in unexpected places.  co-operative efforts
may win out, as leading-edge scientists and many independent innovators
from about 30 countries now are working towards the same goal.&#148;
manning has covered recent developments in free energy technology.
for instance, &#145;cold fusion&#146; has been successfully repeated
and japan, for one, is investing millions of dollars into cold
fusion research. other water fuel cell technologies hold promise
for cleaning up the atmosphere as they power vehicles. revolutionary
advances towards clean, abundant power also use sunshine and heat
in the air or in the ground to make electricity through super-efficient
solar photovoltaics or advanced-concept heat pumps. a canadian
company has developed efficient, small-scale generators which
revolve in a stream of water or in ocean tides without harming
marine life. 
a variety of prototype &#145;zero-point vacuum energy&#146; devices
apparently tap the energy in space. they include magnetic, electrostatic,
electrodynamic, and solid-state ways to generate electricity.
 except for the initial cost of equipment and minimal maintenance,
the expected result will be cost-free electricity. generators
that access this energy are now operating, making it likely that
within the next decade new energy production methods will take
energy out of the &#145;air&#146; with no negative by-products.
changes manning claims we can look forward to in the near future
include no longer having to pay a utility bill or buy gasoline,
and so being able to lease/purchase the energy converter. after
the hardware is paid for, the electrical energy you use is free.
former astronaut with the apollo program, brain o&#146;leary,
phd, gave up lucrative employment&#151;as an ivy league physics
professor, energy consultant to governments, and space scientist
on nasa contracts&#151;in order to address questions which other
academics have ignored up to now. he now lives the challenging
life of an author and independent scientist.  
he says, &#147;because the free energy that surrounds us is such
a vast resource, so potentially clean and decentralized, some
of us believe an energy revolution is imminent. afterward, existing
energy sources may be seen as dinosaur nightmares that littered
our landscape and polluted our air. this revolution could open
a new paradigm of science and technology that would make the copernican
and industrial revolutions appear tame.  redirecting $2 trillion
per year from obsolete power systems to sustainable and affordable
systems is an unprecedented change with vast possibilities.
&#147;a switch to clean &#145;free energy&#146; could almost totally
alleviate air pollution, global warming from carbon dioxide emissions,
waste heat, incidents such as saddam hussein&#146;s ecocidal fires,
black skies, valdez-like oil spills, acid rain, nitrogen dioxide,
sulfur dioxide, hydrocarbon and ozone emissions, unsightly oil
production and refining facilities, dangerous supertankers, gas
stations, power stations, transmission lines, etc.&#148;
manning says, &#147;the energy revolution could affect people&#146;s
lives&#151;their practical everyday choices&#151;profoundly, because
decentralized power means freedom.  it means empowerment to clean
up our environment instead of feeling helpless. the megaproject-builders
will no longer have a leg to stand on when they claim their projects
are necessary.      
&#147;people have to take back their power at the individual and
local level. it won&#146;t be handed back in an envelope from
the government. the tax structure as well as electric utilities
will need to be changed, because of all the energy-related tentacles
that stretch out from capital cities and from financial centers
like wall street and reach into citizens&#146; wallets.&#148;
manning has researched the new energy scene since 1981 and is
in on-going contact  with many inventors, theorists and other
networkers in about a dozen countries. she has attended more than
20 energy-related conferences, in switzerland, west germany, 
canada, and the united states. she has co-authored several books
about  new science, including  suppressed inventions and other
discoveries,  co-authored with christopher bird, brian o&#146;leary
and barry lynes and published in new zealand by auckland institute
of technology press; the granite man  and the butterfly,  co-authored
with pierre sinclaire and published by  project magnet, fort langley;
bc;  and angels don&#146;t play  this haarp, with dr nick begich
of  alaska. 
jeane manning will be giving a public lecture on the free energy
revolution at the vancouver planetarium at 7:30pm on friday, november
15. tickets are available at banyen sound. she will present slides
and video clips of working free energy devices and will be joined
at the podium by some well-known local researchers involved in
anti-gravity, magnetic propulsion, and free energy generators.
