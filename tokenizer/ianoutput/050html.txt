 from cliff&#146;s kitchen 
 raw berry pie 
a simple, no-bake fresh fruit torte that provides plenty of b
vitamins and vitamin c as well as being high in fibre, low in
saturated fat and cholesterol-free.
 1 basket strawberries, stems trimmed
 1 basket raspberries
 1 cup fruit juice
 1 tbsp agar flakes
 almond pie crust (see below)
trim and wash the berries, and place on paper towels to drain.
arrange on the almond pie crust. mix the fruit juice with the
agar flakes in a small pot, bring to a boil for a minute, then
simmer for another minute. let stand a couple of minutes before
pouring over the fruit. chill to set.
 almond pie crust: 
 1 cup almonds, soaked
 1/3 cup raisins or currants
 2 tbsp tahini
 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
pulse chop ingredients together in a food processor until a paste
forms. you may need to stop and scrape down the sides of the food
processor a couple of times while processing. spread into a 9&#148;
pie dish using wet fingers. freeze an hour to set, or you can
bake it at 250 degrees for 30 minutes, before filling. nutri options:
to make this recipe almost fat-free, omit the crust. simply arrange
the berries in parfait glasses then pour in the agar/juice mixture.
chill to set. or to further improve the nutrient content of the
pie, spread a layer of tofu cream on the crust before adding berries.

1/4 cup maple syrup, 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 tbsp lemon juice in
a blender until smooth.)

 from our dietitians: 
have you come across advertising that claims that the calcium
from plant foods is poorly absorbed? spinach is typically held
up as an example. while it is true that we only absorb about 5%
of the calcium from spinach, due to its high oxalate content,
it is incorrect to assume that this automatically applies to all
vegetables. in fact, for low-oxalate vegetables such as broccoli,
turnip, kale, brussels sprouts, cauliflower and chinese greens,
absorption is 50-70%, compared to approximately 32% for cow&#146;s
milk, 31% for tofu, 21% for nuts and seeds, and 17% for legumes.
